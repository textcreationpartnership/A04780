            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(moſt noble Prince) vvhich I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and vvhich my booke conteyneth, and
by many argumentes as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, not only proueth, but alſo
conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to be the only ſincere, and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion; and
vnmaſking the nevv religion by a ſeuere, yet ſyncere Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
declareth it to be nothing elſe but errour, and hereſie, though vnder the
painted face of a Reformed Religion, it <pb facs="tcp:8434:7"/>hath deceiued ſome parte
of the vvorld, and eſpecially your litle vvorld, England; vvhich the Poete
choſe rather to calle a vvorlde by it ſelfe, ſeparated from the greater

and litle vvorld, it conteineth compendiouſly, and in a leſſer roome
(vvhich alſo is a grace) all commodities and perfections, vvhich in the

the nevv religion, then in confirming the olde (bicauſe the good corne
grovveth eaſilie, vvhen the vveedes are extirpated) I entitle it a ſuruey
of the nevv religion. And if your Maieſtie demaund of me, vvhy I dedicate
ſuch a booke vnto you? I can not vvante an anſvveare, bicauſe I can not
vvante a reaſon. Flauius Vegetius vvill tell your Highnes, that it hathe
beene euer the cuſtome, to dedicate boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to Kinges and Emperours (as he

it vvere poſſible, ſhould knovve all. For as in the head vvhich guideth

man that beleeues that ther is a God and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it is euident that Religion
can not ſtande vvithout Preeſtes, ſacrifice, ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; prayer;
but it is euident alſo, that in the nevve religion, none of theſe

abſurd, as that God is not the autour of ſinne, and the only ſinner, that

thou bee a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovver and profeſſour of the late and nevv reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vvhen
thou ſeeſt the fovvle abſurditie of thy ovvne religion, and the

to be prayſed; if ill, myne is the faulte, yet ſuch as I hope ſhalbe

and I haue taken no more paynes then thy good deſerued. If the ſtile of my

and remember, that though the autour bee thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman by byrthe, yet he is

bicauſe he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not vvhat he printed; and I had not the leiſure

for hatred of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And if thou take this my impoliſhed vvorke in good
vvorthe, thou vvilte giue me the occaſion and courage to take in hande
another, in vvhich I ſhall explane (as I haue in parte allready) and make as

Indulgences, Merit, Satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvorſhip of Saintes, Images, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,

impoſsible to pleaſe God, and that out of the true Church, 
<note place="margin">See the ſecond booke, and 4. chap.</note>
there is noe ſaluation: As God is but one, the truthe but one, ſo his
Religion, Church, and vvorſhip is but one. This Church and Religion is not to
be found amongeſt the reformers, as my ſecond booke vvill tell thee,
bicauſe it hathe all the markes of hereſie: It is only to be found
amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the Catholikes, vvho are Nicknamed Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, as thou mayeſt
ſee by the ſame booke, and by ſome chapters of the firſt booke, and by
other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the other bookes, euidently demonſtrated. The Catholike
Church then is the hauen of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <pb facs="tcp:8434:25"/>to vvhich thou muſt
repayre, It is the porte of Saluation, the Arke vvherin Noe lodgeth &amp; his
familie, that is Chriſte and his faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, It is the barne vvhere
the good corne is layed vp, till the vvinovving day, It is the folde of
Chriſtes Sheepe, The piller of truthe, The treaſure-hovvſe of Chriſtes
Graces, The Shoppe of ſpiritual Negotiation, The lande of promiſe, The
paradiſe of the ſecond Adame, The Temple of the ſecond Salomon, The
miſticall body of Chriſte, The terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial heauen of thoſe that hope
to be bleſſed, The only vvay to life euerlaſting. If then thou deſire
to be free from tempeſts, and contrarie vvindes of diſagreeing hereſies,
direct thy ſhip and ſaile to this quiet hauen; if thou vvilt not make
ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvrake of thy ſoule, fly to this porte of Saluation; If thou vvilte
not be drovvned in the deluge of ſinne or Infidelitie, haue recourſe vnto
this Arke, out of vvhich none can eſcape damnation; If thou vvilte be of
Chriſtes choſen corne, repoſe thy ſelfe in this his barne, vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is
the only place of purging from the chaffe of ſinne; If thou vvilte be one of
Chriſtes flocke, ronne to his folde, that thou mayeſt be fedd vvith his

the piller of truthe; If thou vvilte bee enritched vvith Chriſtes ſpiritual

traffique for heauen, and heauenly merchandiſe, enter the Shopp of Chriſte,

oblations, nor ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, are pleaſing; If thou vvilte receue any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and motion from Chriſte the Head, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate thy ſelfe to the
Church his myſtical body; and if thou vvilte bee pertaker of his ſpirite,
vv<hi rend="sup">th</hi> is the ſoule, and life of this body, diſmember not thy ſelfe, that
thou mayeſt be a liuely member; If thou vvilte enioy the bliſſe of Angels
in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per heauen, enter firſt into this lovver heauen, out of vvhich is
no hope to aſcend to the higher; If thou vvilte attaine to life

one of the Church triumphaunt, bee firſt one of the Church militaunte; and if
thou vvilte haue God for thy father, take his Churche for thy Mother. Nothing
more dangerous then to liue out of this Churche, and no ſurer damnation, then
to dy out of this Churche. Be not careleſſe therfore in ſeeking out this

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes vvhich conne on their ovvn hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des before they be ſent, and preach

but alſo in faieth and religion, lett them tell vs their miſſion and
ſhevv vs their commiſſion, and vve vvill reuerence them as the

But if they come on their ovvne heades or cannot giue vs aſſurauuce that

for if they be not ſent they haue noe authoritie to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le <pb n="7" facs="tcp:8434:29"/>vvith vs, and if they cannot proue their miſſion vve haue noe

inſending preachers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs I fynde in holy vvrite, vvhich alſo haue bene
practiſed in the church of god, the one an extraordinarie the other an
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie miſſion. The extraordinarie miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made immediatly from
god, the ordinarie miſſion god maketh by meanes of ſome other vvhom he
hath ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie from him ſelfe. For as god ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie doth nothing
immediatlie by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but by meanes of ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de cauſes, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
light by the ſonne, and heate by the fire, producing fruites by trees, men
and beaſtes by ſome of their ovvne kinde, yet he doth not ſo tye him
ſelfe vnto his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but that ſome tymes extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he
vvorketh by him ſelfe vvithout any concurrence of them as he did vvhen vvith
a vvorde, or touche, he reſtored health, vvhich ordinarilie he doth by
phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cauſes, ſo likvviſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie god ſendeth
paſtours and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> authoritie by others, yet
ſometymes alſo extraordinarilie he ſendeth them immediatlie from him
ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe. As for example: Moyſes and Aaron in the olde lavve vvere ſent
immediatlie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god to recall his people out of Aegipt, and <pb n="8" facs="tcp:8434:30"/>to rule and gouerne them in matters of religion; but the highe
preeſtes vvhich ſucceded Aaron and vvere conſecrated by him and his
ſucceſſours, vvere ſent by an ordinarie miſſion. In like manner in
the nevve lavve, ſaint Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles vvere called
and ſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarilie &amp; immediatlie from Chriſt but they vvhich
ſucceded the Apoſtles and vvere ordained by them by impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des
and other ceremonies, vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſent by an ordinarie miſſion, bicauſe oure
ſauiour Chriſte vvhem he inſtituted his Apoſtles did alſo appointe a
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall order, by vvhich others ſhould ſucceed them in their offices,
vvhich vvas impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des by a Biſhop lavvfullie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and
ſo the Biſhops vvhich novv are, maie trulie affirme that they are ſent

conſecrated &amp; inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the order vvhich Chriſte hath appointed
and they ſucceded the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vvhom Chriſte immediatlie ſent to

that he vvas inſtituted by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes vvhich Chriſte hath lefte

Aeſops crovve they proudly decke them ſelues vvith other byrds fethers. For
vvhat right or title haue they to ſcriptures of vvhich they are ſo
prodigal? or hovv came they to get the poſſeſſion of ſcripturs? truly
as theeues ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke poſſeſſion of other mens goods. For Catholikes haue

the true and lavvful poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours <pb n="34" facs="tcp:8434:43"/>of ſcripturs.
Yea hiſtories, and the ancient bookes of the fathers, vvho from the firſt

<note place="margin">Second booke chap. 1.</note> bicauſe as
herafter ſhalbe proued vve only are the ſucceſſours to the ancient

caſt them in lavve, if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re but about apeece of ground,
I ſee noe reaſon, but that if the reformers of this tyme and the Catholike
ſhould put this caſe to any indifferent iudge, to vvit vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they or
Catholikes are the lavvfull poſſeſſours of ſcripture, the iudge
muſt needes giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the Catholike par tie vvhich vvas the firſt
poſſeſſour, &amp; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour euen from the Apoſtles of holy
ſcripture. Yea the Reformers of this age Luther and Caluin vvhen they began
to preach, receiued not the Bible of any of their praediceſſours, bicauſe
before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ther vvere no Lutheranes, nether vvere there Caluiniſts
before Caluine, but they found the Bible in the Catholike &amp; Romain Churche
vvhich euer had the cuſtodie of this treaſure, and out of this Churche they
tooke the Bible elſe had they neuer come to the knovvledge of it, and ſeing
that they tooke it vvith out the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:8434:43"/>lavvfull ovvners leaue, it
muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv that they are theeues and noe lavvful
poſſeſſours, and conſequently haue no right to vſe it eſpecially
againſt the right ovvner. Vvherfore if they vvill fight vvith vs vvith noe
other vveapons then ſcriptures vve muſt firſt put them to the proofe of
their title, leaſt vve admitte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſcriptures, vvho haue no right vnto
them, and permit them to vſe our ovvn vveapon, to cut our ovvn throats. And
ſeing that they can not proue them ſelues lavvfull poſſeſſours of
ſcripture, nether are vve bounde to diſpute vvith them by ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nether haue they any right or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to alleage ſcripture againſt vs.
But yet as I haue declared, heretikes fingers itche, and are neuer vvell but
vvhen they are fingring of Scripturs, and their tongues are neuer ſo glibbe,
as vvhen they are fauced vvith textes of ſcripture. And vvhy thinke you do
they ſo vvillingly alleage ſcripture, and decide all by the bare letter of
ſcripture? Many reaſons there are vvhy they do ſoe. For firſt their
guiltie conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vrgeth them therevnto. For as the fovvle and
beautileſſe mayde, perceuing her defect and vvante of natural beautie, is
fayne to vſe extrinſecal colours, to make a ſhevv of beautie vvher in

very dull pates, vvho vvith all their ſtudie, induſtrie, prayer, faſting,
ſolitude, to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues, philoſophie, and ſanctitie of life, could not attain
to that knovvledge of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in a longe lifes tyme, vvhich a miniſter
by and by getteth at the firſt opening of the Bible. But tell me in good
ſadnes: are you in ieſt or earneſt vvhen you ſay that ſcripture is
eaſie? Vvhen you read the firſt chap. of Gen. the prophecies eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Daniel, the Pſalmes of Dauid, Iobes vvitty ſayinges, Salomons Prouerbes
and Canticles, ſainct Paules epiſtles, S. Ihons Apocalipſe, do you fynde
no difficultie? I can not thinke it, bicauſe euen experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce teacheth that
nothing is more euident then that ſcripture is not euident. For firſt the
very letter and phraſe of ſcripture is obſcure and ambiguous. Secondly
many ſpeeches in ſcripture are prophetical, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parabolical, many
metaphorical, vvhich commonly are full of obſcuritie. Thirdly it is proper to
ſcripture to haue many ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnder one letter, as the literal ſence
vvhich the holy vvriter firſt intended, and this ſenſe ſome tymes is
ſignified by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <pb n="51" facs="tcp:8434:51"/>vvords, ſome tymes metaphorical,
yea ſometymes alſo this literal ſenſe vnder one letter, is diuers.
Sometymes the ſence is ſpiritual vvhich is that vvhich the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnder
the letter do ſignifie as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thoſe vvords of ſainct Paule
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hame had tvvoe ſounes one of the handmayd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the free

                     </gap>.</note> literally do
ſignifie Abrahames tvvo ſonnes, bicauſe that the letter importeth and
that firſt is intended, but theſe tvvoe ſonnes vvere figures of the old
and nevv Teſtament or the tvvoe peoples vvhich liued vnder thoſe
Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſo this is the ſpiritual ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe
vvords vvhich they not immediatly but by meanes of thoſe tvvoe ſonnes do
ſignifie. And this ſence is ether moral or tropological vvhen it tendeth to
manners, or allegorical vvhich tendeth to fayth or the Churche, or anagogical
vvhich tendeth to heauen or life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. Vvherfore this vvorde
Hieruſalem literally ſignifieth the citie ſo called, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, the
ſoule of man vvhich God inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth by good life or the deuil by badde,
allegorically, the Church militant, and anagogically, heauen and the Churche
triumphant. Novv vvho is he that dareth promiſe to tell vs infaillibly vvhen
a place of ſcripture is to be vnderſtood literally or ſpiritually and in
vvhat literal or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <pb n="52" facs="tcp:8434:52"/>meaning? 
<note place="margin">in c 16. Ezec.</note> Sainct Hierome affirmeth
that Apollinaris, Tertulian, and Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and other millenarians, imagined
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſurrection, a reedification of the Temple and terreſtrial
Hieruſalem, and that Chriſt in it ſhould raigne for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares
and vve that tyme ſhould liue in all corporal pleaſurs, bicauſe they
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detſtood certain places of ſcripture literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly, vvhich
ſhould haue been vnderſtood ſpiritually &amp; metaphorically. And
contrarivviſe the ſame father aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Origens errours in the

the ſayed chapter ought to bee vnderſtood meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically and
ſpiritually, vvhich ſhould haue been interpreted hiſtorically,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie, and literallie. And vvhat man in his vvitte can thinke it ſo
eaſie to hit allvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes of the right ſenſe, vvhere the ſenſes are
ſo diuerſe and in vvhich ſo many learned men haue banguered. Truly vvhen
I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider vvith my ſelfe hovv euident a thinge it is that ſcriptures
are hard and obſcure, I meruaile hovv our Reformers can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſelues that ſcriptures are eaſie. and ſome tymes I ame induced to think
that vvhen they ſay ſo they ſpeake not as they thinke? but yet vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I
call to mynde another opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theirs, vvhich is that the <pb n="53" facs="tcp:8434:52"/>true meaninge of ſcripture is that vvhich euerie ones priuate
ſpirit imagineth, I ſee it to be as eaſie to interpret ſcripture, as to
imagin, vvhich is moſt eaſie, bicauſe the imagination is free and can as
vvell ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Chimeraes as true obiectes. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample if that vvere the
true meaning of Ariſtotle vvhich euery one vvould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, then vvere it an
eaſie matter for euery cobler to vnderſtand Ariſtotle vvere he in Greek
or Latin, bicauſe he can imagin vvhat it pleaſeth him vvith great
facilitie. And this if I be not deceued is the cauſe vvhy novv euery
ſiſter of the lord vvhom ſainct Paule commaundeth to be ſilent in the
Church, vvill needs bee a bibliſte and an interpretour of Scripture. For if
that bee the true ſenſe of ſcripture vvhich the priuate ſpirit
imagineth, if ſhe haue the ſpirit (as vvhy ſhould ſhe not as vvel as
the miniſter eſpecially it being a receued doctrine amongeſt them that
euery one by his priuate ſpirit can iudge of ſcripture) vvhy may not ſhe
comment vppon the ſcripture, and mount alſo into the pulpit, there to
preach the doctrine of her ſpirit. But o fancies, o Luciferia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pride, to
vvhich hereſie leadeth euen the frayle and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sexe vvhich nature

<note place="margin">Lib. praeſc.</note> This pride Tertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian

heretical vvomen hovve malapert are they, vvhich dare be ſo bold as to
preach, and to take vppon them to exorciſe, and to promiſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
cures, yea perhaps to baptize.</hi> And vvheras Apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tices are bound
ſeauen yeares to an occupation, to learne only a mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal trade, the arte
and ſcience of expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſcripture vvhich is the higheſt ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
that is, ſeemeth to theſe ſubtile vvittes ſo eaſie, 
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Paul.</note> that as ſaint Hierome
obſerued in ſome of his tyme, euery cobler, euery olde trotte, and doting
foole can vvith out a Doctour fynde out the ſecret meaning of ſcripture,
and teach before they be taught. But let them ſaye and beleeue if they can or
vvill, that ſcripture is eaſie, the experience &amp; reaſon vvhich I haue
allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vvill proue the contrarie. And truly if hony bee hidden in the combe,
marovv in the bone, and pretiouſe ſtones in the ſea, if gold be gotten
vvith labour out of the bovvels &amp; ſecret vaines of the earth, and roſes
be hedged in vvith pricking thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, if nature hath hidden all perfection and
naturall ſciences &amp; vealed them vvith ſuch obſcuritie that vvithout
great indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie they can not be diſcouered, good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vvas there that
the myſtical meanings <pb n="55" facs="tcp:8434:53"/>and ſacred ſenſes of
ſcripture ſhould be vealed vvith an obſcure letter and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vvith
many aenigmatical ſpeeches. For firſt by reaſon of this difficultie the
ſtudy of ſcripture aſketh a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vvholle life, and ſo keeping him
occupied, diſtracteth him from prophane, idle, and euil occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly
the difficultie of ſcripture makes a man to haue a better eſteem and higher
conceipt of the ſame, bicauſe things eaſily learned are eaſilie
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, 
<note place="margin">Li. 2. doct. Chriſt. c. 6.</note> &amp;
knovvledg hardly gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is highly priced. And therfo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re as S. Auſtine noteth,
the holy ghoſt in ſcripture hath prouided eaſie things to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our
honger, &amp; obſcure places alſo to take avvay lothſomnes. Bicauſe our
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vvith eaſie things only, vvould be ſoone cloyed, &amp;
vvith obſcuritie only vvould eaſilie be deterred. Thirdly this difficulcie
imprinteth in our memorie the vvord of God more deeply. For as the iro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more
harde to receue impreſſion then vvax or vvater, yet keepeth it more
firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that vvhich vve learn hardly, vve forget not eaſilie. Fourthly

(vnleſſe it be by a glimſe and glimmering) the ſplendent rayes of

ſo conſtantly vvee beleeue thoſe verities vvhich in ſcripture are
rather vea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them reuealed. Sixthly this difficultie preſerueth ſcripture
from prophanation, and is the cauſe vvhy euerie one can not babble of
ſcripture as they do of eaſie thinges, and as the heretiques of this tyme
do, bicauſe they imagin ſcripture to be eaſie. Seauenthly it hides our

S. Auſtin vvho read Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in Millan, vvas not S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vvhoe vvas
excellent in all the three tongues, a Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian? They vvere, They vvere, and
yet they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed as I haue declared, that ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures vvere full of
difficultie. Yea in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland our miniſters haue the Bible in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and
ſo haue no need of any helpe of <pb n="59" facs="tcp:8434:55"/>Grammer, and yet can they
not aggree about the ſcriptures meaning. Yea in all ſciences, it is one
thing to be a gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian another thing to attayn to the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the
ſcience, for many a ſchool maiſter in England can conſtrevv
Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vvhich yet can not vnderſtand him, and if grammer vvere
ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then after grammer, vvee ſhould need no ſtudie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in

conſtrevved the pſalmes, tell me vvether they do yet vnderſtand the
pſalmes? But my aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvill ſhevv that hee is not tongue tyed and
therfore vvill not bee put to ſilence. If (ſayeth hee) you confer one place
vvith another, one vvill explicate another. This is another ſtarting hole
vvhich hee hath found out. But this alſo is but a poore ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fte. For
although one place conferred vvith another many tymes giueth a great light to
both, yet doth it not ſo allvvayes fall out. For diuerſe haue conferred the
ſame places and yet haue gathered diuerſe meaninges, yea ſomtymes
conference of places augmenteth the difficultie, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſhovv of
contradiction vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeared not. Novv gentle reader thou vvouldſt
think that this man vvere <pb n="60" facs="tcp:8434:56"/>ſatisfied or elſe that his
mouth vvere ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but yet he deſireth one anſvvere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and if that

(ſayeth he) to illuminate you, he vvill reveal the meaning of ſcripture
vnto you, or if you haue the ſpirit &amp; be not carnall but ſpirituall, or
if you be praedeſtinate, you ſhall finde all as playne in ſcripture, as
the kinges high vvay. This anſvvere is ſo poore, that it vvell argueth that
our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie is put to an harde ſhift and to a laſt reply: bicauſe
in this anſvvere hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth <hi>ignotum per ignotius, an vnknovven thing
by that vvhich is more vnknovven.</hi> As for example, I vvould haue him to
aſſure vs vvhether that vvee expound ſcripture rightly or vvrongly &amp;
hee telleth vs that if vve praye as vve ought to do, or if vvee bee of the
electe, or if vvee bee ſpirituall men, vvee ſhall eaſiilie finde out the
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of holy ſcripture. And ſeing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is more vncertayne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vvhether vve praye as vvee ought to doe, vvhether vvee bee electe or noe, or
vvhether vvee bee true ſpirituall men or noe: by this rule vvee ſhall
neuer, bee aſſured of the true ſenſe of ſcripture. And vvere not I
praye you ſainct Auſtine, ſainct Hierom, and other ffathers before
mentioned, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte Saintes of God? vvas it not like that if 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8434:56"/>any prayed a right, that they did ſo? vvere not they
liker to bee ſpirituall men, then our fleſhly ghoſpellers, vvhom their
vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues can not content? Or can the reformers aſſure vs that they them
ſelues are electe, that thy praye iuſte as thy ought to do, that they are
ſpriritual menne vvhoe haue the right ſpirit of interpreting ſcripture?
It follovveth therfore vvhich I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proue that if vve beleeue theſe
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, bicauſe they alleage ſcriptures according to their ovvne
expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvee muſt of neceſſitie giue eare vnto all falſe
prophetes, vvho can, and haue already &amp; herafter vvill alleage ſcripture
for vvhat ſoeuer they ſhall preach; and ſo if theſe Reformers be
admitted no heretikes nor hereſies can be excluded or reiected. Vvhich
concluſion although it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ꝓpceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the premiſes,
vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are layed dovvne, yet to helpe the readers memoire, I vvill laye
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dovvne again breefly, that out of them he maye gather the intended
concluſion more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily. Thou muſt therfore (gentle reader) calle to
mynde vvhich before is proued; to vvite that it hathe allvvayes been the manner
of heretikes to alleage ſcripture, and vvith ſuch cloakes to conceal their
hereſies; That they had no authoritie to vſe ſcripture againſt our
vvilles vvhoe ar <pb n="62" facs="tcp:8434:57"/>the only lavvfull poſſeſſours;
that all thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe they perforce haue ever vſed them, yet in very deed they

Suenkfeldius therfore denieth all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſcripture, and is ſo
ſpirituall, that he vvill liue only of the ſpirit, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the
vvorde, nor Sacraments. But Luther and Caluin admitt both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the
vvorde of ſcripture, mary yet they vvill haue the ſpirit to giue
ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſcripture and the meaning of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For if you aſke
them hovv they knovve that fayth only iuſtifieth? they <pb n="74" facs="tcp:8434:63"/>vvill anſvver by ſcriptur. But aſke them hovv they knovv that
vvhich they alleage for that opinion to bee ſcripture, or that to be the true
meaning of ſcripture in vvhich they take the ſcriptures by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged?
They vvill not ſay that by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, councells, or Church, they at
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but by their ovvn priuat ſpirit. So that although Caluin
vvriteth againſt the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines for relying only on the ſpirit, yet at
laſt hee falleth into the ſame labyrinth him ſelfe, for vvhileſt he
vvill be iudged by ſcripture, yet ſo that his ſpirit muſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
ſentence vvhich is ſcripture, and vvhat is the meaning therof, he
pronounceth the laſt ſentence, from vvhich is no appeal, by his priuat
ſpirit. Againſt this ſpirit of theirs I could bring many arguments, but
of it ſelf it is ſo phantaſticall, that theſe fevv ſhall ſuffice to
refute it. Firſt I ſay, that allthough God might haue gouerned his Churche
by internall reuelation of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate ſpirit, vvhich ſhould propoſe vnto
euery one in particuler, vvhich is ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp; vvhat is the meaning
therof, vvhich is true fayth, vvhat is the vvill of God, vvhich is the vvay to
ſaluation, and vvhat are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, neuer theleſs this vvere a
gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t rather for angels then for men. for men are viſible and haue a
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conuerſation, and therfore are tobe <pb n="75" facs="tcp:8434:63"/>directed
by viſible paſtours, viſible lavves, and rules, and nor by an inuiſible
ſpirit? For this cauſe allmightie god vvhoe could ſanctifie vs as he
dothe the angells vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible meanes, yet bicauſe vvee ar men, he
hath alvvaies beſtovved his graces vppon vs by ſenſible ſignes and
ſacraments and by a viſible diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſation of men. Secondly ſuppoſe
God ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern euerie one by his invvard ſpirit, yet this vvere not
ſufficient for others amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt vvhom vve conuerſe for hovve ſhall they
knovv my ſpirit to be of God, and not of the deuill? Vvherfore this ſpirit
is not ſufficient to gouern and directe men in a peaceble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation:
bicauſe vvhileſt euery man vvould bragg of his ſpirit, and none could
proue the ſame vnto othersno more then our ſpirites in Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d can, they
vvould fall together by the eares about their ſpirits and neuer ſhould bee
able to parte the fray or to end the controuerſie. Thirdly nether is this
ſpirit vnleſs it be ioined vvith a plain reuelation (as our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
heretiks ſee by experience that it is not) ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a mans ovvne
ſelfe to rely on for the aſſurau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; quietneſs of his
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For I aſk of him that thiks him ſelf moſt aſſured,
hovv he knovves that his ſpirit is of God &amp; not of the deuil? If he
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the ſpirit bringes, vvith it a cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain <pb n="76" facs="tcp:8434:64"/>firme perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhich makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his thinking aſlured; I
ſay that this is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, bicauſe euerie heretike yea euery Turk
hath this invvard perſuaſion, and Suenkefeldius vvho denyed all Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
and ſcriptures, and vvould be guided only by the ſpirit, vvas fully thus
perſuaded by his ſpirit, vvhich he alſo did verilie think to bee of God.
If theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought verily that they had the ſpirit of God, and yet vvere
deceiued; vvhy may not Caluin, vvhy may not euerie brother, begin to doubt of
his ſpirit? Yea vvhy ſhould vve beleeue him on his bare vvord, to haue the
true ſpirit vnleſs he can proue it by miracles or the authoritie of the
Churche to vvhom Chriſt promiſed this ſpirit, vvhich he can neuer do. For
as for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles heneuer could rayſe a dead lovvſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life, and
to proue his ſpirit by the authoritie of the Church, vvere to proue it
conformable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpirit of the Chriſtian Church, vvhich he nether
can nor vvill do, bicauſe be vvill be ſinguler. If he proue his ſpirit by
the ſcripture he vvindes him ſelf in a circle out of vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he can neuer
get him ſelfe out vvith honour or honeſtie. For euen novve he proued
ſcripture and the meaning therof by his ſpirit, and novv he proueth his
ſpirit by the ſcripture, and if you aſke again hovv <pb n="77" facs="tcp:8434:64"/>he knovves this to be ſcripture, he vvill anſvver, by his
ſpirit, and ſo vvill neuer get out of this circle but vvill ſtill proue
ſcripture by his ſpirit, &amp; his ſpirit, by ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for vvhich
kinde of argument the Logicians, vvill deride him and hiſſe him out of the
ſchoole. For to proue ſcripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by
ſcripture, vvhich ſcripture according to Caluin is not knovven but by the
ſpirit, is to proue the ſpirit by the ſpirit, and idem, per idem. But
behold I pray you to vvhat the deuill can perſuade man vvhen he hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his eyes by depriuing him of the light of fayth. Ther is nothing ſo ſecret
vnto man as is this ſpirit; bicauſe the harte of man is a bottomleſs

vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed they ar the ſpirite of the deuill, vvho long ſince promiſed
that he vvould be a lying ſpirit in the mouths of all falſe prophets, and
yet every brother of the nevv religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvaranted nether by miracle, nor euident
reuclatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor Churche, nor councell, vvill needs be perſuaded yea and
aſſured alſo, that his ſpirit is of God. Fourthly God had 
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8434:65"/>been vnreaſonable if he had giuen vs no other iudge to
interpret his lavves, then this ſecret ſpirit. For he hath bound vs to a
religion vvhich is aboue reaſon and often tymes againſt ſence and
ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and this he hath deliuered vnto vs in a booke very obſcure
and harde to vnderſtand, and vvith all he hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vs to the beleef, and
obſeruarion of this lavv and religion, vnder paine of ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall damnation.
Novv if he hath giuen vs no other interpretour of this lavve but our ovvn
priuat ſpirit vvhich is to ſecret and ſubiect to errour, he ſhould
ſeem to haue intended and deſired our damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to haue giuen vs a
lavve not for a rule to direct vs but for a ſnare to catch vs, and a pitfall
to ruinate vs, by cauſe vve can not keep this lavve vnleſſ vve
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and not keeping it vve ſhalbe da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned. Truly better had
princes prouided for their ſubiectes then God for his, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe princes
make plain lavves and yet leaſt the ſubiectes ſhouſld plead ignoraunce
or complain that they are puniſhed for not keeping a lavve vvhich they
vnderſtand not, they haue prouided interpretours vvhoſe gloſſes are
playne; and yet Chriſt our lavvegiver according vnto Caluins opinion, hath
giuen vs an obſcure lavve, and a more obſcure interpretour to vvit 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8434:65"/>the ſecret and vncertain ſpirit, and vvith all exacteth
hell paines of vs if vve obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not his lavve in the right ſence &amp;

he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and hereſies vvhich according to my promiſe I ſhall proue
euidently and laye open manifeſtly. For if that be true ſenſe of
ſcripture vvhich the priuat ſpirit ſuggeſteth, if the reformed nevv
religion bee the ſincer religion bicauſe it is ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ruled by
ſcriptur, or rather by ſcripture interpreted by the priuat ſpirit, then
certainly by the ſame vvay that this pretended religion is entered in to the

falſe prophetes and falſe apoſtles, claime free paſſage alſo, and
by no equitie can be excluded if Luther, Caluin and their brotherhood bee

old age vvas euer reſpected, olde coynes priced, ancient ſtatues admired,
old vvritings eſteemed, and in all artes, the moſte ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t profeſſours
of the ſame, bear the bell a vvay. In painting Appelles hath the credit aboue
all painters, in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary vvorks Lycippꝰ; in comedies Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and
Terence; in Tragedies Seneca; in hiſtories Liuie, Saluſt, Iuſtine; in

not the ancient fathers and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Church, vvho by their arte

their arte befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re oure vnlearned and vpſtart miniſters? ſhall antiquitie
giue credit to Poets and painters, and not to Doctours &amp; interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of

Vvhileſt they reiect the fathers as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvho might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erre, are they godds or

many of them vvould neuer haue bene able to make a ſermon, had they not the

Vvhitakar) Luther in ſome caſe may prefer him ſelfe before all the
fathers, &amp; a thouſand Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For vvhen his doctrine is according to
ſcripture then is it to giue place to noe fathers. But this is as much to the
purpoſe as the patch beſide the hole, bicauſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon is not
betvvixt fathers and ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, vvhich are to be preferred: bicauſe the
fathers allovved and alleaged ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re euen for thoſe pointes of doctrine
for vvhich Luther doth, and all the Luthers in the vvorld can not proue that
all the fathers held any one opinion againſt ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; but the queſtion
muſt be, vvhether Luther or all the fathers did beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the
ſcripture; and therfore if Luther hold againſt the fathers in expoſition
of ſcripture, he preferreth him ſelfe before them all. As for example,
Luther alleageth ſcripture to diſproue free vvill, all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alleage
ſcripture to proue it, and Luther expoundes ſcripture one vvay, they
another, elſe they could not both alleage ſcripture for contrarie doctrine.
Vvherfore if Luther ſayeth that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth ſcripture truly, and therfor
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res not for all the fathers, he preferreth his ovvne iudgment before them
all, and ſo can not anſvvere that argument groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="98" facs="tcp:8434:75"/>in
the fathers authoritie, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, him ſelfe vvith this, that he
forſooth hath the vvord of God vvhich is aboue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. And ſo Luther
muſt giue vs leaue to come vppon him vvith his ovvn argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vvhich he
ſhall neuer anſvver. The Church from the begi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning hathe taught, and
expounded ſcripture other vviſe then thou doeſt, ſo many Auſtines,
Ambroſes, Ciprianes, Councells, and ages, haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched other vviſe. Are
they all deceiued haſt thou only found out the truth? What if thou rather

be the ſincere chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, or rather the religion of the

let vs ſee in a vvord hovv by reiecting this infallible authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie 
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8434:77"/>of fathers, they leaue noe certain rule for expoſition
of ſcripture, and ſo open the gapp to all heretiques and hereſies. For
lay avvay fathers vvhich vvere in all ages counted the only paſtours of the

of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the authoritie of the Church is of as litle eſteeme, bicauſe

and the priuate ſpirit, &amp; ſeing thoſe tvvoe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re authorities, as
before is proued, open the gappe to all hereſies, the denyall of the fathers
authoritie muſt needs do the ſame. For ſuppoſe a nevv heretique, yea a
deuill from hell in the likeneſſ of a man, ſhould preach a nevve
hereſie contrarie to all the hereſies that euer vvhere, might he not
alleage ſcripture for it, expounding it as he pleaſeth? And if you demaund
of him hovv he knovveth that he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it aright, might he not ſay that
his ſpirit telles him ſo? And if you alleage that all that euer taught

their miſſion, finde therin a great defect: for ether it is an ordinarie
miſſion; and then they muſt ſhevv a ſucceſſion of paſtours
vvhoſe roomes they ſupply, vvhich I ſee they can not do, bicauſe noe

elſe I muſt by the ſame reaſon harken vnto euery fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe prophete.
Nether doth it ſuffice to ſay that they preach no other doctrine then the
Apoſtles did, and therfore need no other miracles then thoſe vvhich vvere

&amp; netherequall, nor coequall, nor conſubſtantiall, to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Yea
do not all heretiques ſay ſo, doe not all the Reformers ſay ſo, euen
vvhen they hold contrary opinions? I ſee noe reaſon therfore not ſo much
as probable vvhy I ſhould harken vnto theſe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, vnleſſ I vvill
harken allſo vnto all the heretikes that euer vvere or ſhall bee. Much
leſſe can I ſee any reaſon vvhy to forſake my ancient paſtours,
vvho made me and my for fathers Chriſtians, and to preferre theſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
reformers before them. For as for learning they ſurpaſſed theſe
reformers, and for vertu they excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſo vvere more likely men to
ſee into the ſenſe of ſcripture, and veritie of religion, and vvere
fitter inſtruments for God to vſe, and veſſelles more capable of God
his ſpirit and reuelations. In antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they are before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by many
hundred yeares, in number they are an hundred at leaſt for one; for
authoritie they vvere honourable Prelats, and Biſhops of the

and authoritie by ſucceſſion, yea and by miracles alſo; nether of
vvhich proofes the reformers can alleag for their miſſion, and authoritie.
Shall I then leaue ſuch learned men for ſuch young clat kes, ſo

ſo late vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtartes, ſo many for ſo fevv, and men of ſuch paſtorall

ſeing that God vvil not bynde me to giue credit to them that can bring no
probabilitie, for their ovvn or their Doctours authoritie, I ſee not hovv
vvith any ſhevv of iuſtice God can at the latter day condemne me, for not

vnleſs ther be a Superiour to tune theſe diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe natures, &amp; a head
to direct theſe diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe membres of the body of the Church. And as the
Sheep vvhich vvant a Shep heard can not longe keep together, but are like to

ſocieties, and not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but alſo principalle. For although
the obedient &amp; complying nature of the ſubiect doth help much to the
mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of peace and order, yet the head and Superiour moſt of all
preuaileth. For as the head is the principall part, ſo doth it beare moſt
ſvvay in the gouernment of the body; vvich is the cauſe vvhy the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is
affected according to the head, and vvhy the ſubiect follovveth the princes
humour. Yea euen as vvhen the head in mans body is intoxicated the vvholle
bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reeleth, and if the head vvant eyes the body tumbleth into ditches, and
falleth into daunger; ſo if the head of a ſocietie be inconſtaunte, the
vvholle ſocietie vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth, if the ſuperiour vvant eyes of
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, the ſubiectes are in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Vvherfore Philip King of
Macedo and father to Alexander the great, vvas vvonte to ſay, that he had
rather haue an armie of fearfull harts gouerned by a Lion, then of lions ruled
and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a harte: inſinuating ther by, that as the head in a
ſocietie is the principall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo is it the moſt neceſſary. If
then the Church of Chriſte be a peaceble, and vvell ordered body, it hath a
head to gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de and rule it. And if vve looke into the gouernment of the ſame
euen from the <pb n="137" facs="tcp:8434:94"/>beginning, vve ſhall finde that this
good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common vvelth neuer vvanted a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and gouernour. In the lavve of
nature firſt of all Adam our firſt parent, as he vvas our common father
according vnto fleſh, ſo vvas he a preeſt and paſtour of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of all thoſe vvhoe liued in his tyme, and a gouernour of his familie vvhich
vvas deſcended of him, not only in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall, ciuill, or temporall, but
allſo in ſpirituall matters concerning fayth and religion. For this cauſe
he vvas indevved vvith all knovvledg and ſcience, that as the firſt doctour
he might inſtruct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his poſteritie; and although by his falle, he
loſt all infuſed knovvledg, yet did he ſtill ſo longe as he liued,
remain pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour and ſupreme head of the Church. Vvherfore Theophilus

religion; and this ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie as it ſeemeth belonged allvvayes
vnto the moſt ancient, to vvhom all the reſt as they vvere in age inferiour
ſo vvere they ſubiect in authoritie. As for example Abrahame and Sem, vvere

Sem of Noe, yet bicauſe Sem vvas the moſte ancient, he vvas the higher
preeſt,

recourſe vnto the preeſt of the Leuiticall <pb n="140" facs="tcp:8434:96"/>lavv vvho
ruled at that tyme, and God threatneth that if any bee ſo proud and
ſtubborn as to refuſe to obey his ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, he ſhall ſuffer death by
the decree of the Iudge. Vvhere a blind man may ſee that the ſynagogue had
her Iudge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies in religion. And ſhall vve imagin
that the Church and ſpouſe of Chriſte, vvanteth a head to direct her, and
a Iudg to giue her ſatisfaction in all doubts of religion? No, no, in the
lavve of grace, as God hath beſtovved more grace on his Church then on his
Synagogue, ſo hathe he prouided her of a Iudge and gouernour, vvhom for his
Churches ſake he aſſiſteth more particulerly. And firſt of all
Chriſte him ſelfe vvhileſt he liued gouerned this Church him ſelfe, and
in all points played y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parte of a ſupreme head, high preeſt, and
paſtour. For he inſtituted a nevv lavv, a nevv ſacrifice, &amp; nevv
ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, he ordayned preeſtes and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and gaue them
authoritie to preach, &amp; to miniſter, and to gouern in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, vnder
him. And after that he had vvithdravven his viſible preſence from vs, he
lefte vs not vvith out an vnder-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, but preſently after his
reſurrection, he appointed ſaint Peter his vice-gerent in earth, that
ſtill the Churche might haue a viſible iudge to vvhom ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payer 
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8434:96"/>in all her difficulties. 
<note place="margin">Io. 21.</note> For after his reſurrection he
appeareth to his Apoſtles and ſingling out ſainct Peter from the reſt,
he demaundeth of him three tymes not only vvhether he loued him, but alſo
vvhether more then the reſt; and finding in deed that he did ſo, and that
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly he vvas the fitteſt (for the cheefeſt thing in a paſtour

the charge of his ſheep, in ſo ample manner, that he excepteth none, but
giueth him authoritie ouer all both lambes and ſheepe, that is leſſer and
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtianes, euen Apoſtles &amp; Biſhops, vvho all muſt
acknovvledge Peter for their paſtour, if they vvill be the ſheep of
Chriſt. For as ſainct Bernard noteth, 
<note place="margin">l. de conſid.</note> vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ther is no
diſtinction, there is no exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. And ſeing that after ſainct Peters
death the Church hath noe leſſe need of a viſible paſtour, then before
it had, as Chriſte left him for his vicegerent, ſoe in him did he appoint a
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall ſucceſſion of his ſucceſſours, that the Church might
allvvayes be prouided of a viſible pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour. And therfore as biſhops are
the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the other Apoſtles, ſo ſome one muſt
ſucceed ſainct Peter and muſt haue that ſuperioritie ouer other
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, vvhich ſainct Peter had ouer the <pb n="142" facs="tcp:8434:97"/>Apoſtles.
And truly to omitt other proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, noe man more likely to be this man then the
Biſhop of Rome. For in the Sea of Rome ſaint Peter did laſt of all
reſide, there he dyed, and there, before his death he appointed Clemens, vvho
refuſing, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſucceeded, and after him Cletus, after him Anacletus,

reſiding, ruleth the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che not only of Rome but of all the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

that the parlament is our Iudge in matters of religion? yea vve ſee that
parlamentes varye in religion, and ſo they can giue noe certain ſentence
for religion. In Fraunce the Parlament is Catholike and is content to be
ſubiect to the Pope, and in no vviſe vvill meddle <pb n="148" facs="tcp:8434:100"/>vvith matters of religion. In King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tyme the eight of that

boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of ſcripture are canonicall, and vvhich is the true meaning, they
vvould anſvvere that ſuch matters belonge not vnto them. But they vvill
anſvver that the parlament is Iudge vvhen it is conformable to ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
as it is at this preſent, but vvas not in Queen Maries tyme. Thus they may
anſvver but vvith hovve litle reaſon, it vvill eaſily appeare. For ether

aggreeth the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne of the true Chriſtians. For as in the

ſo novv vve that are called by the ſame names of Catholikes and

true Chriſtians, vvho as they neuer chaunged name, ſo neuer chaunged
religion, and the reformers vvho are called Lutheranes, Caluiniſtes,

muſt needs be condemned for heretikes. And as before that the ancient

therfore in his book of the notes of the Churche, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that the Church
neuer quite decayed but only for the moſt parte, and ſo (ſayeth he) it
decayed euen in the apoſtles tyme, for as Chriſte (ſayeth he) from the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had his Church, ſo the deuil had his chappel vvhich vvas bigger
then the Church, &amp; ſo there hath been euer a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8434:128"/>of both, but the chappel as it vvas euer bigger ſo vvas
it moſt famouſe. And this chappell (ſaieth he) is the Church of the
Papiſts, vvhich is ſo famouſe in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtories. But
this ſhifte is poore and ridiculouſe. For if the Church of the Papiſts
degenerated from the beginning as Simon Magus did, vvhy vver not vvee called by

then vvas theirs the chappel, for it is againſt the nature of a chappel to be

then vvas ours that ſocietie vvhich vvas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Chriſtian
Church, then vvas our ſocietie that vvhich condemned hereſies and called

iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t-ſeats: for if you conuent them before Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Iudges,
or the vvholle Church, they vvill ſay that they are not lavvfull Iudges, and
that it is not the true Church, vvhich ſummoneth them to appear; and therfore
they are not bound to ſtand to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, vvho haue all authoritie,
on their ovvn ſide: And if you aſke them from vvhome they had authoritie,
they vvill ſay that they had their predeceſſours to vvhom they ſucceed,
and their Church vvhoſe fayth they preach, and that from them they haue
authoritie; if you then bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhevv ſome hiſtorie or ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Church, they vvill anſvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that it vvas inuiſible and ſoe
vvill ſay vvhat they liſte, and by noe Church paſte or preſent ſhall
you be able to controlle them, for they haue a Gygas ring to goe inuiſible
by. Secondly if the Church vvas inuiſible you can not vrge them to ſhevv
any continuall ſucceſſion of it from the Apoſtles. For they vvill ſay
that their Church ſucceeded the Apoſtles, and is the ſame vvhich they
planted, but after the Apoſtles tyme, vvas neuer ſeen till Luther pulled
avvay the buſhell vvhich couered this light. And truly I vvill eaſilie
graunt that their Church before Luther <pb n="205" facs="tcp:8434:129"/>vvas inuiſible.
For that vvhich vvas not could not be ſeen; but that the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vvas

Truly if the Churche ether decayed or vvas inuiſible, then vvas the vvorld

vvho hauing lefte the Churche, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſtand to her cenſure,
haue nothing to make them aggree. For nether is bare <pb n="228" facs="tcp:8434:142"/>ſcripture, nor the priuat ſpirit ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they

they are ſufficient: vvhich doctrine I ſhall laye open in the ſame booke

paſſion vvas the ranſome, vvhich freed vs from all lavves. Fourthly that
vvee are bound to noe ſatisfaction bicauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſatisfaction vvas

bicauſe Chriſtes iuſtice being ours, noe ſinne can make vs ſinners,
vvhich doctrine ſhalbe ſet dovvne in the ſame booke. Sixtly that noe hell

this life, nor puniſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next. And in theſe pointes they ſaye that
Chriſtian libertie conſiſteth. So that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte according to theſe
doctours opinions, hath redeemed vs from the ſlauery of ſinne, bicauſe
his iuſtice being ours noe ſinne can hurte vs, hee hathe deliuered vs from
the yoke of the lavve, bicauſe noe lavve can bynd vs, hee hathe deliuered vs
from hell and the deuill, bicauſe hovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer vve liue, if vvee beleeue
that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes iuſtice is ours and our ſatisfaction and payment, the
deuil hathe noe povver to puniſh vs in his Helliſh priſon, bicauſe
Chriſte hathe ſuffred the payne devve to our ſinnes before hand. Vvherin
the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet reader may eaſily perceue vvhat an abſurd Redeemer they
make Chriſte to bee. For if Chriſte hathe redeemed vs from the ſlauery of
ſinne bicauſe noe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne can hurte vs, then dothe hee open vs the gappe

other ſatisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at our handes, then doth hee in a manner egge vs forvvard
to all vice, from vvhich noe man vvill abſteyne, if fear of hell do not
bridle his vnruly appetites, and keepe him in avve. And ſo Chriſtes
paſſion vvhich vvas a ſacrifice to aboliſhe ſinne, is a cauſe of
all ſinne, and Chriſte vvhoe came to redeeme the vvorld from ſinne,
filleth the vvorld vvith ſinne, and ſo is an abſurd redeemer, ſo to
redeeme vs from ſinne, that hee inuiteth vs and eggeth vs forvvardes vnto
ſinne. So they make Chriſt not vnlike to that father vvhoe ſeing the
exceſſiue expences of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſonne, dothe not commaunde him to
vſe more thriftines, but payes before hand to all diſers, cookes,
Inkeepers, and merchauntes, all that poſſibly hee can looſe at diſe, or
lauiſh out in apparell, or conſume in banquetting: vvherin hee doth nothing
elſe but inuite his ſonne to all vnthriftines, vvhoe needes neuer to care
hovve, hee ſpendeth, vvhen all his debtes are payed before hand. For ſo the
ghoſpellers ſaye that Chriſt perceiuing, that vve could not keepe the
lavve, freed vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all lavves, and ſeing that vve could 
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:8434:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>not auoyd ſinne, imputed his ovvne iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
ſo vnto vs, that noe ſinne can hurte vs, and knovving that vvee vvere not
able to ſatisfie for ſinne, hee abode the pain him ſelfe, and vvould haue
none required at our hands. And in ſo doing, vvhat elſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the hee doone,
but opened the vvide gate to all licentious libertie, vice &amp; iniquitie?
Hovve farre more reaſonable is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Catholike Churche, vvhich
affirmeth that Chriſtes paſſion vvas not our formall iuſtification nor
ſatisfaction, but only the meritorious cauſe of our redemption and
ſaluation: vvhich deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for vs at Gods handes grace by vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> together
vvith our cooperation vve may be ſaued and redeemed. For as vve fell by our
ovvne vvilles into captiuitie, ſo Chriſt thought it good that by our ovvne
vvilles together vvith his grace (for vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace vvee may fall but vve can
not riſe again) vve ſhould riſe vp again and vvinde our ſelues out of
the ſeruitude of ſinne and the tyranie of the deuill. So that Chriſt hath
redemed vs from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of the lavve, not that the lavve by ndeth vs
not, but bicauſe Chriſt hathe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken avvay the heavineſſe of the lavve,

bondage of ſinne, not bicauſe noe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne can be imputed vnto vs, but
bicauſe his paſſion hathe deſerued grace for vs, by vvhich vvee maye
diſpoſe our ſelues to iuſtification vvhich is a reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
ſinne to nevvneſſe of life, and by vvhich vvee may auoid ſinne
vvhenſoeuer vve are moued there vnto. Chriſt alſo hathe freed vs from the
tyrannie of the deuill and captiuitie of Hell, bicauſe he hathe procured vs
grace, by vvhich vvhen the deuill by him ſelfe, or the vvorld or the fleſhe
prouoketh vs, vve may reſiſt, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all the force of hell. Chriſt
alſo hathe ſatisfyed for our ſinnes, not bicauſe his paſſion
vvithout any cooperation on our part doth ſuffice, for ſo, as is proued,
the gate vvere opened vnto all iniquitie, but bicauſe his paſſion had

Betvvixt a Preeſt and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is a neceſſary relation by vvhich one

ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce then that of the croſſe, as our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries affirme, then
is he not a perpetuall Preeſt, bicauſe he hathe noe ſacrifice vvhich
ether by him ſelfe or by his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is perpetually offerred. To ſay
that the ſacrifice of the croſſe ſtill remayneth in effect, bicauſe
by that vve receue grace and redemption, and from that our ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes haue
their efficacie, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. For the effects of this ſacrifice are
noe ſacrifice, and the ſacrifice it ſelfe is not perpetuall, bicauſe it
vvas but once offered, and ſo that ſacrifice is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make

Chriſte a Preeſt according to the order of Melchiſedech, bicauſe there
is noe reſemblau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvixt their ſacrifices. If our aduerſaries vvould
graunt, as Catholikes do, that Chriſt in his laſt ſupper offered him
ſelf as a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce vnder the forme of bread and vvine, I could eaſily
ſee hovv Chriſt is an aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Preeſt according to Melchiſedechs

hathe it the formes of bread and vvine, and is vnbloudy as his vvas. But rather
then they vvill graunt this (ſuch is their hatred againſt the Maſſe)
they vvill deny, agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt flatte ſcripture, that Melchiſedechs bread and

naturall ſonne of God, knevv full vvell that his father nether vvould nor
could deny his ſone, and vvas aſſured that he vvho vvas to ſitte in

And is it likely that God vvho indevved Chriſtes humaine nature vvith all
knovvledge, and reuealed to him all ſecrets euen harts cogitations, and the
day of dome, vvhich the Angells knovv not; vvould keepe this only ſecret from
him, &amp; vvould not let him knovve vvhat ſhould become of him ſelfe at
the day of his death? The diumes vvith one common conſent are of opinion that
Chriſts ſoule from his conception, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the bliſſe and glorye
vvhich at the day of our particuler iudgement, or at our deliuery out of
Purgatorie our ſoules <pb n="322" facs="tcp:8434:189"/>ſhall receue, and they ſay
that to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſoule is devv a glorified body, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the glory of
the ſoule naturally imparts it ſelfe vnto the body; and that in Chriſt,
it vvas noe miracle that his body vvas ſo gloriouſe in his transfiguration,
but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it vvas a miracle that his glorious ſoule did not make his body
alſo perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that glory from the beginning; but yet this miracle
Chriſt vſed that he might ſuffer honger, thirſt, cold, and other
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, vvhich he could not haue doone in a glorified bódy. Hovv
then vvas it poſſible that Chriſte ſhould feare his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tribunall,

of his ſoule, and vvas aſſured that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe ſoule ſhold haue
at the length, that is after his paſſion, a glorified body. But ſayeth
Caluine: Chriſt had taken vppon him our ſinnes, and therfore might very
vvell feare to appear before his fathers iudgement-ſeate. This is his
diuinitie or rather blaſphemie. For if he mean that Chriſt hath ſo
vndertaken our ſinnes that he verily made then his ovvn, vvhat more
blaſphemie could be vtter? for although Illiricus auouched that God the
father ſo potently imputed our ſinnes to Chriſte that he made him a

argevveth the moſt effeminate, and covvardly harte that can bee. I anſvvere

dolefull tragedie of his paſſion, vvhich he acted after vvards vppon the
ſtage of his croſſe. But Caluin hath not yet caſt all his poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he
ſayeth that Chriſt not only feared iudgement and damnation, but diſpaired
alſo of his Saluation. Theſe are his vvords vvhich vvith the other before,
I tranſlate out of his frenche Harmonie: 
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>But this ſee meth abſurd that a voice of deſperation ſhould
eſcape Chriſte. The anſvvere is eaſie: that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe the fleſhe
apprehended damnation yet fayth remained firme in his harte.</hi> Vvhere you
muſt note that Caluin hauing diſcourſed vppon thoſe vvords <hi>my God
my god vvhy haſt thou for ſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me:</hi> he ſayeth, that this vvas the

vvas <hi>bicauſe he vvas conuented before his fathers tribunall as culpable
and as one that had God his enemie and <pb n="326" facs="tcp:8434:191"/>as a man all ready
condemned, vvher vvith he vvas ſo ſcarred and affrighted that it had beene
enoughe to haue ſvvallovved vp all other men an hundred tymes. So that
complaining that he vvas abandoned of his father he ſpeaketh not of
faintneſſ nor in ieſte,</hi> for (ſayeth he) <hi>the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie of the
greefe vvreſted out of him this complaint, for as he vvas preſented as a
pledge for vs, ſo vvould he ſuſteine verily the Iudgement of God in our
name.</hi> And bicauſe in theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he ſeemed to auouch that
Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired as one forlorne &amp; forſaken of his father, he
ſayeth that yet his fayth remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firme. Is it ſo Caluin and did Chriſt
as he vvas man ſo feare the iudgment-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, that he diſpaired? Then,
ether that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire vvas deliberate, or ſodaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberate. If
deliberate then certes did Chriſte ſinne moſt danmably; for vvhat greater
ſinne is ther, then to diſpaire of Gods mercie? For he that diſpaireth
ether he thinks not God able to ſaue him, or not vvilling, in the one he
dothe iniurie to gods omnipotencie, in the other he miſpriceth his mercie. If
indeliberate, then vvas Chriſte inconſiderate and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed a vvay vvith
Paſſion like a beaſt or vureaſonable man, vvhich althoughe Caluin
ſticketh not to graunte (for he ſayeth that the vehemencie of his agonie
vvreſted out of him feare and diſpaire <pb n="327" facs="tcp:8434:191"/>ere he vvas
avvare) yet do all the fathers and diuines in this pointe ſtand againſt
him, affirming that neuer any paſſion in Chriſt preuented reaſon and
conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yea they conceiue of Chriſt as of one that vvas ſo
vigilante ouer his paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that neuer any aroſe vvithout

commaunded a paſſion of anger to ariſe, yet in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as it
might ſhevv him to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe and yet nether teſtie nor furiouſe.
Likevviſe vvhen it pleaſed him to afflicte his harte vvith feare and
ſorovve, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded thoſe paſſions to ariſe in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie,
vvhich vvas expedient to iuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for vs, or to ſhevv him ſelfe a man, and

vvas deliberate, and yet noe ſinne, bicauſe if the Superiour patte be
reſolute, it is noe ſinne thoughe the inferiour parte fear deathe as
contrarie to nature. Nether vvas that complainte a deſperation of Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for Chriſt (as before is declared) vvas ſure of that, but it vvas a
complainte of the ſenſuall parte vvhich complained that it receiued noe
ſuccour from the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but vvas left as it vvere to it ſelfe, to

<note place="margin">See the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th booke, and third

Saluation, he loſt his faith, bicauſe he loſt that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, &amp;
ſo by Caluins doctrine, vvas an infidelle. Nether vvill Caluins ſhifte be
ſufficient to holde theſe tvvoe (to vvit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce and deſperation
together) for to ſay, as he ſayethe, that this deſperation in Chriſte
vvas indeliberate and ſo might ſtande vvith faithe, is to vphold one
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie by another, for it is moſt abſurde to aſcribe vnto
Chriſte any inconſiderate, or indeliberate actions: better vvere it for
Caluin to ſaye as diuines commonly ſaye that there vvas noe faythe in

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of death of Chriſtes

vvas only able to ranſome our bodyes but not our ſoules, he detracteth from
the dignitie of Chriſts deathe, and ſeing that the ſcriptures and fathers
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge noe other price to haue bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne offred for vs then Chriſtes
deathe and paſſion, if that vvere deficient, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Caluin,
Chriſte is noe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Redeemer. But he preſſeth vs vvith an argument

<note place="margin">Supra.</note> for (ſayeth he) he that
ſatisfieth for another muſt pay the debte vvhich he ovveth, and

Chriſt in ſoule ſhould ſuffer the paynes of hell, elſe had he bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
but hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe a redeemer. But by this argument Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte ſhould haue endured in
hell perpetuall tormentes, and ſo ſhould neuer haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs, bicauſe
he ſhould him ſelfe haue been a perpetuall priſoner; for if Chriſte
muſt needs ſuffer the ſelfe ſame paine vvhich vvee deſerued, then
muſt he according to Caluins rule haue endured a perpetuall hell, bicauſe
that vvas the puniſhement prepared for vs, and ſeing that eternall
puniſhement neuer comes to an ende, Chriſte ſhould neuer haue payed the
ranſome devv for ſinne, and ſo vve ſhould neuer haue been redeemed.
Vvherfore I ſaye that Chriſtes paſſion, to the ſufferaunce of vvhich
bothe Chriſtes body and ſoule concurred (for the body by it ſelfe alone
can not ſuffer paine) vvas a ſufficient ranſome to redeeme bothe our
ſoules and our bodyes from hell and damnation, and therfore to that only and
not to the paynes of hell the ſcriptures &amp; fathers do attribute our
redemption. 
<note place="margin">See the third booke &amp; third chap.</note>
And this (as I haue proued allready) vvas a moſte ſufficient price, and
ſo ſufficient, that in that it vvas the paſſion and deathe of him that
vvas God and man, it vvas ſufficient to haue redeemed a thouſand 
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:8434:196"/>vvorldes, yea the deuilles &amp; damned alſo, nether
muſt Caluin bee ſo rigorous as to thinke that noe ſatisfaction can bee
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, vnleſs it bee of the ſame kinde vvith the debte vvhich is to
bee payed, or the harme vvhich is to bee repaired; for if one of Caluins
brotherhood had cut of the arme of another brother, vvould not a peece of mony
haue made ſatisfaction for the mayme? or vvould Caluin haue exacted arme for
arme? And if one had ovvght Caluin an hundred crovvnes vvould not he haue beene
content to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taken the vvorthe or more then the vvorthe in corne, ſheepe,
or ſuche like, but needs muſt haue crovvne for crowne, as thoughe there
vvere noe other lavve but <hi>lex talionis?</hi> or if ſatisfaction for
theſe debtes and loſſes may be made by other paymentes vvhich are of
aequall valevve, then might Chriſte by ſufferinge deathe vvhich vvas of

conuenient that Chriſte ſhould ſuffer the paines of hell. For firſt
thoſe pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes are of their nature perpetuaell and ſo if Chriſte had once

theſe groſſe abſurdities: for the ſame God vvho commaundeth to adore
and ſerue him only, commaundeth vs to honour our parents and to ſerue our
maſters. And reaſon teachethe vs that if vve honour and loue God vve muſt
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte his frends and thoſe that he reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, for the prouerb
muſt needs be true, <hi>Loue me loue myne,</hi> bicauſe it is grounded in
reaſon and the very nature of frendſhip. Vvherfore I anſvver that God is
aiealouſe God, and therfore vvill haue ſuprem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and affection giuen
vnto him ſelfe only, bicauſe he only hath ſupreme ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranitie, (vvhich
only the alleaged places do proue) but if it be lavvfull to make this argument;
God only muſt haue ſupreme honour ergo ſaincts muſt haue none at all;
It may alſo be as vvel inferred that nether our parentes, nor our Princes
muſt <pb n="349" facs="tcp:8434:202"/>be honoured, or affected. Let therfore the
reformers calle to mynde, that to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and dignitie honour is devve,
&amp; therfore ſeing that ther are three kinds of excellencies, vvell haue
the diuines diſtinguiſhed three kinde of honours or vvorſhips. The
firſt excellencie is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and ſupreme, vvhich is proper to God, and
therfore to him is devv ſupreme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vvhich is called <hi>Latria,</hi> and
to giue this honour to any creature is idolatrie. The ſecond is called morall
or ciuill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, vvhich conſiſteth in authoritie, morall vertue, and
learning, or ſuch like, and to this is devv a ciuill honour vvhich vve giue
to Princes, and ſuperiours and morall-honeſt men, and learned men: for
authoritie, vertue, and learning, are to be reſpected. The third excellencie
is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall vvhich conſiſtethe in grace ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, and glorie,
&amp; to this is devv a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe honour: yet bicauſe this excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie is
infinitely inferiour to gods excellencie, vve muſt giue vnto it a religious,
but yet a farre inferiour honour. And vvith this honour our bleſſed lady,
ſainct Ihon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſte, ſainct Peter, ſainct Paule, and other Saincts
vvhileſt they liued deſerued to bee reſpected, and ſithence that their
ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie is noe leſs in heauen then it vvas in earthe, they are noe
leſs after death to <pb n="350" facs="tcp:8434:203"/>be honoured then they vvere liuing.
And therfore as Ciuile honour giuen to Princes, learned, and morall men,
dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateth not to Gods honour bicauſe it is inferiour, ſo nether dothe
this religiouſe honour, bicauſe it is inferiour. But Caluin ſayeth that
religious honour is only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve to God. This he affirmeth but he can not proue
it, and therfore I deny it, and vvill proue the contrarie. For religion is a
vertue vvhich giueth to god ſupreme vvorſhippe, and to Saincts, and holy
thinges, inferiour honour, and ſo reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth euery one in his kinde. To
God this vertue giues a ſupreme honour called <hi>Latria,</hi> to the Saincts
an inferiour honour called <hi>Dulia</hi> to the bleſſed virgin bicauſe
ſhe farre excellethe the other Saincts, it giueth an honour inferiour to
<hi>Latria</hi> but ſuperiour to <hi>Dulia,</hi> vvhich diuines calle
<hi>Hyperdulia.</hi> And I vvould demaund of Caluin, if Saincte Ihon Baptiſte
vvere in earthe, vvhether hee vvould honour him or noe for his ſanctitie? If
hee ſaye hee vvould, then I aſke of him, vvhat honour hee vvould giue him?
not Supreme ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: bicauſe that is devv to God, not Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honour;
bicauſe that is giuen to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue only, authoritie, and learning. Vvhat
honour then ſhall ſainct Ihon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſte haue for his Sanctitie? certainly
ether <pb n="351" facs="tcp:8434:203"/>an inferiour religious honour called <hi>Dulia</hi>
or none at all. And if Caluin vvould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him in earthe, and religiouſly
alſo for his ſanctitie; vvhy feareth he to giue him that honour in heauen,
ſithence that his ſoule (vvhich is the proper ſubiecte of ſanctitie) is
noe leſſ liuing there, then it vvas here, and is indevved vvith noe
leſſe ſanctitie in heauen then is vvas in earth, and beſides that, is
alſo there enriched vvith glorie, vvhich it had not here? Novv if Caluin
vvill ſaye that at leaſt images and reliques are not to be honoured,
bicauſe in them is none of theſe three excellenties afore mentioned: I
vvill tell him that althoughe none of theſe excellencies be formally in
images or reliques, yet bicauſe theſe are appertainning vnto them vvho are
honoured, they may and muſte alſo bee ſomething reſpected and
reuerenced (but vvith a farre inferiour reſpecte) and that for their ſakes
to vvhome they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteined. For as the Prince &amp; Superiour hathe only the
ciuill excellencie, and yet not he only, but for his ſake, his image, his
chaire of eſtate, his ringe, and after his death, his dead body alſo is to
bee reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but yet not vvith that honour vvhere vvith his ovvn perſon
is honoured, ſo if God and his ſainctes maye be honoured vvith religious
honour, then for God his <pb n="352" facs="tcp:8434:204"/>ſake, his image may be
reſpected, and for Chriſtes ſake his name, his, vvorde, his Sacramentes,
his croſſe, nayles and other thinges belonging vnto him, and for the
Sainctes ſake, their images, bodyes, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, clothes, and ſuch like, may
and muſt bee religiouſly honoured, yet vvith an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour honour. And the
reaſon is firſt bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in theſe things alſo by a certaine
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation and repreſentation, vve behold in ſome ſorte their
excellencie to vvhome they pertaine, and therfore vve reſpect them for their
ſakes. Secondly the nature of frendſhip vvill haue it ſoe, that if vve
honour and loue any, vve muſt reſpect for his ſake all belonging vnto
him, euen vnto his dogge. But Caluin vvill ſaye that greater vvould be the
honour of Chriſte, if vve gaue all honour to him, and none at all to his
ſaincts; vvhich hee affirmeth and I vvith more reaſon do denye. For as then
I honour and loue my Prince beſt vvhen I ſoe reſpecte him, that I honour
and loue not him only, but for his ſake his alliaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, his frends, his
officers, his ſeruauntes his image, yea his ringe: ſo do I honour and loue
Chriſte moſte, vvhen for his ſake I reſpecte and honour his mother, his
officers, the Apoſtles, his freindes, the ſainctes, yea his croſſe and
image. And as Princes take it for a diſ honour to haue <pb n="353" facs="tcp:8434:204"/>their officers, ſeruaunts, and images abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp; count it an
honour to be honoured not only in them ſelues, but alſo in their
adherentes; ſo no doubte Chriſt accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the honour doone to Sainctes
(bicauſe it is giuen them for his ſake and bicauſe they are his freinds
and ſeruaunts) as giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him ſelfe, and can not but conceiue him ſelfe
to be highly diſhonoured, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Saints, yea his mother, are reuiled, and
his Croſſe and Images are defaced and defiled. Vvherfore let not the

but rather honour to the Prince, to honour his officers and ſeruaunts vvith
an inferiour honour for his ſake, ſo is it noe idolatrie but religion, to
honour the Saints of God vvith an inferiour honour, for their Maſters ſake.
And if Saints may be honoured, vvee maye make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto them,

vnto the vevv of any reaſonable man, the abſurditie vvhich follovveth
contempte of theſe thinges and the traiterouſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto Chriſte,
vvhich it implyeth. Put the caſe that ſome one in Ingland of his
Maieſties ſubiects ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs great loyaltie, loue, and honour
vnto him, yet could not abide to hear a good vvord of his gloriouſe mother,
yea vvould reuile her, and miſcall her, but vnder this <pb n="358" facs="tcp:8434:207"/>pretence that his Maieſtie is novv to haue all the honour, and that
noe honour can be giuen to the mother, but ſo much is taken from the ſonne.
Suppoſe he ſhould paſſe by his lorde chauncelour, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
vvithout mouinge capp, and appear before his honourable counſaill vvithout
bovving of body, or bending of knee, and being demaunded vvhether his capp vvet
not nayled to his head, or vvhether his knee vvanted not a iointe, he ſhould
anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver them, that his cappe is nayled to all but his Maieſtie, &amp; his
knee is ſtiffe to all but his ovvn good ſelfe: Suppoſe alſo he ſhould
deſpiſe his fauourites, and hate them as much as hee affecteth them,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that he only loueth his Maieſtie, to vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth ſo much
of his affection, that he hath none lefte for his freinds or vvelvvillers.
Suppoſe that vvhen he ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into the chamber of preſence he ſhould
make no more reuerence to his Chaire, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an alehovvſe benche; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that vvhenſoeuer he meeteth vvith his Graces picture, he ſhould deface and
defile it, and ſhould caſte into the fier vvhat ſoeuer he findeth that
hathe been vſed by him, and all vnder this pretence that he giueth all
reſpecte vnto his ovvn perſon, and vvill not giue any at all to any thinge
elſe, bee it neuer ſo neare, or ſo <pb n="359" facs="tcp:8434:207"/>deare vnto him,
leaſt he ſhould ſeem to parte ſtakes, and not to giue all honour and
affection to his Highnes: Suppoſe alſo that he ſhould ſtopp all ſutes
vvhich are made vnto his Chauncelour, Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, Counſailours, and other
offices, avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that ſuch ſuters are traytours to his Maieſtie, vvho
in that they goe not to him immediately, doe ſeem not to put that confidence
in him, vvhich his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ requireth, but rather do imagine that ether he
is not able of him ſelfe, or elſe not ſo vvilling, as able: vvould you
take this man to bee a loyall ſubiect? or vvold you not, (not vvith
ſtanding all theſe his goodly pretences and ſolemne proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious)
ſuſpecte his ſinceritie? and might you not iuſtly feare, leaſt after
contempte of all that are belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging vnto his Maieſtie, he vvould laye violent
hands vppon his ovvn perſon? Truly I doubt not but that ſuch a one vvould
quickly be areſted, and apprehended for a traytour. The like caſe is
betvvixte Chriſte Ieſus, and theſe nevv reformers, and zelatours. They
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all honour, dutie, and affection to Chriſte, but they reuile
his mother, and vvill haue no honour giuen vnto her, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt that in honouring
the mother they ſhould diſhonour the ſonne. They beare noe reſpect vnto
Chriſtes cheefeſt <pb n="360" facs="tcp:8434:208"/>officers the Apoſtles, to vvhom
he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Church at his departure. They fauour not at all the freinds
and fauorits of Chriſte, the ſaincts, and angells; and this they ſaye
they doe for feare leaſt they ſhould incurre Chriſts disfauour, in
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring them vvhom he him ſelfe did fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure. Vvhen they meete vvith the
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Chriſte or of his mother, or frendes, they deface and defile it;
Vvhen they ſee the croſſe of Chriſte they ſvvell at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſight
of it, as if they vvere poſſeſſed, and can noe more abide it, then can
the deuill, vvho bicauſe he hateth Chriſte can not brooke his croſſe.
If they ſhould hit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any bone of Chriſtes frendes, they vvould
ſpurne at it, and if any relique of Chriſte, or his mother, or his
Apoſtles, and other ſaints, ſhould be in their vvaye, if a dunghil vver
not nere hand, they vvould caſte it into the fier; All ſutes and
requeſtes, vvhich are made to the Mother of God, or any ſainte, officer, or
freind of Chriſte, they forbid and condemne as iniuriouſe to Chriſte, as
though (ſay they) Chriſt vvere not able or vvilling enough of him ſelfe,
but that the vvay muſt be made by mediatours and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours. Theſe
are their goodly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but vvhat litle ſigne of true meaning tovvards
Chriſte therby is ſhevved, the <pb n="361" facs="tcp:8434:208"/>lavv of frendſhip

loue his alliaunce, frends, and all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining vnto him euen vnto his

ſacraments vvere in the lavve of Moyſes, and ſuch as baptiſme, and the
ſacrament of the Altare are in the lavve of grace. Thirdly bicauſe he had
offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded God by vſe of corporall thinges, it vvas conuenient that by

and make him ſatisfaction by ſuch thinges as he had done him iniurie. For

theſe ſenſibles ſignes and Sacraments, vvhich are farre inferiour vnto

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie. The firſt is
coniunction of man and vvoman, vvithout vvhich mankind can nether be propagated

Chriſte did his Church, and beare the burdens of vvedlocke more eaſily. The
ſecond thing is conſtitution of Princes, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, or magiſtrates to
rule this humaine ſocietie, vvhich matrimonye hath propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. For if the

as ſhalbe herafter related and refuted, that only fayth iuſtifiethe:
vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt conſequently ſaye that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes giue noe

is that noe faithfull man can pray for iuſtification or remiſſion of

follovvethe that in praying for remiſſion of ſinnes, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth faithe,
bicauſe in that hee prayeth, hee ſhevvethe that hee hathe not that
aſſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce; for vvho vvill pray for that vvhich he is aſſured of

Caluin teacheth falſe doctrine; but Caluin vvill ſvveare that he teacheth
the truthe and that hee is ſure that a faithfull man is ſure of his
iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, remiſſion of ſinnes, and election; and therfore you knovve
vvhat follovveth. But leaſt you thinke that I doe iniurie to Caluin in
affirming that hee taketh a vvay the lords prayer, as vnlavvfull and quite
repugnaunte to Chriſtian faithe, I vvill proue it manifeſtly and by no
other argument, then by calling to mynd that vvhich is allready ſayed. In the

vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> as is before proued vve can not praye for, vvithout loſſe of our
faythe, vvhich, if it bee right, aſſureth vs vvithout all doubte that thy

permit vs to fall into temptation, and by tentation, but rather vvill deliuer
vs from all euil eſpecially of ſinne: vvhich petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo is vaine yea
impoſſible if Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins faithe bee true. For if by faith I bee aſſured
of future iuſtice, I can not pray vvith harte that God vvill aſſiſte
mee that I fall not from iuſtice, bicauſe I ame (as Caluin ſayeth) full
vvell aſſured that I ſhall not falle, and ſo I can no more pray, that I
may not fall by tentation, then that the heauens may not fall vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee, being
as ſure of the one, as the other. And ſo the Lordes prayer can not ſtande
if Caluins doctrine do goe for curra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; and ſeing that this prayer vvas made
by Chriſte, if vvee vvill follovve Caluin vvee muſt forſake Chriſte,
&amp; for as much as this prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth in a breefe ſomme, and methode,

can not ſay this prayer, vvhich is a <hi>Compendium</hi> of all prayers and
petitions, vvee can not praye at all, and ſo noe prayer can be vſed in
Caluins Church according to Caluins doctrine. Vvherfore I meruaile not that
ſo litle prayer is practiſed amongeſt them, I vvonder not that thy build

rather I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that they ſometymes exhorte me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prayer ſeing that
their doctrine &amp; prayer can not ſtande together. And I like better of
Luther and of his plaine dealing in this matter, for he hauing once pronounced

this Church teacheth vs that God neuer vſethe euill perſons as

and after vvards vſethe this their ſinne, ether to the iuſte

patience by euill perſons is tryed, or to a greater repentaunce of the

repentaunce, as Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen did. And certainly it is as euident that God can
not be the autour of ſinne, as that he can not but be God. For firſt of all
God is of a good nature and goodnes it ſelfe, and therfore as euill frutes
can not proceed from a good tree, bicauſe they are contrarie to the good
nature and diſpoſition of the tree,

As for example (ſayeth he) of the ſame ſinne vvhich the Chaldees
committed in vniuſtly afflicting Iob, God vvas the autour, Sathan vvas the

ſinned not in that actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but did vvell and iuſtly in the ſame action in
vvhich they ſinned, and tranſgreſſed. But this vvill not ſerue for an
anſvvere, for firſt if god may bee the autour of ſinne to exerciſe the
patience of the iuſte, or to chaſtice the vvicked, he may alſo be the
autour of a lye, for the puniſhment of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſo Scriptures muſt
loſe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, bicauſe peraduenture they are lyes vvhich God hathe put

more then tyme to dravve nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro our concluſion, and therfore out of Caluins

vvill not ſuffice to excuſe God from being vnreaſonble, bicauſe at
leaſt in that ouer plus vvhich exceedeth our force and povver, hee ſhevveth
him ſelfe vnreaſonable. as for example if the King vvould commaund a

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs, bicauſe hee vvould make vs to ſee our imbecillitie and to doe

commaundamentes, and therfore in theſe commaundementes God ſhevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him

vvhy brute bealles maye not bee commaunded not to kill one another, not to liue

deuoide of compoſition, that in him is noe diſtinction but of perſons,
vvhich allſo are one indiuiſible God, and therfore as an indiuiſible
pointe is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether touched, or not at all, bicauſe it hath no partes, ſo
our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ether rightly attaineth vnto the knovvledge of God, or not
at all, and if it erre in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God it erreth in all, bicauſe
all is one. And ſo if an heretique denieth any thing of god, hee denyeth all.
But althou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe all heretikes are in ſome forte idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, yet I vvill not
denye but that there is a difference betvvixte them, and paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For theſe
men deny the true God in <pb n="474" facs="tcp:8434:265"/>expreſſe termes and adore
ſome creature for God, as Iupiter, or the planetes, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſuch like,
but heretikes only affirme ſome thing of God, vvhich implyeth a denyall of
the true God, yet they profeſſe in vvordes, religion vnto the true God.
Novv therfore if all heretikes bee in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me forte Idolatours; then certainly

Secondly man eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is diſciplinable, deſirouſe to learne of
others, and by diſcourſing and deuiſing, to knovv vvhat other men thinke
and conceue. For as he is vvilling to imparte his ovvne conceites, ſo is he

Out of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine I inferre as a moſte euident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that in
vaine Princes haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer their ſubiectes, for if the ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
maye chuſe vvhether hee vvill obey or no, then the prince may commaund and
hee maye anſvvere, that as hee is not bound to obeye bicauſe by Chriſtian
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie he his freed from all mens lavves, ſo hee vvill not at this tyme
obeye, and ſo in vayne ſhall the Prince commaunde. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly I conclude out
of Luthers and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins premiſes, that there are noe Princes nor Superiours
ouer Chriſtians, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that all Chriſtian Princes are
vſurpers, bicauſe they chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; authoritie ouer
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, vvhich in deed they haue not, and vvill needes bee Princes and
ſuperiours, vvho are but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men. For if they can not ſo comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und vs
as to bynd vs to obedience, then are vve not ſubiecte to them, and
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they are noe Superiours; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe vvee maye obey them of
free choiſe, yet that makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, bicauſe ſo vvee
maye obey our equall and inferiour if vvee vvill, yet bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
bynde vs in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience to <pb n="488" facs="tcp:8434:273"/>obey, he hathe not authoritie
ouer vs, and vvee in that vvee are free are not ſubiecte vnto him. Vvhich
that it may the more plainly appeare, vve muſt note that a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and a
ſubiecte are correlatiues, as are the father and the ſonne, the maiſter,
and the ſeruaunte, bicauſe as the father is the ſonnes father, and the
maiſter the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes maiſter, ſo a Superiour is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes
ſuperiour. And as noe ſonne no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, noe ſeruaunte, noe maiſter,
ſo noe ſubiecte noe Superiour, bicauſe correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues are of that nature
that one inferreth another, and one can not bee vvithout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Vvherfore if
all Chriſtians be ſet at ſuch libertie that they are not bound in
conſcience to obey any Princes lavves then are they not ſubiecte vnto them,
but as free as hee that hathe noe Maſter; and ſeing that vvhere is noe
ſubiect, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re can not bee any Superiour, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvethe, that if Princes
can not bynde vs to obey them, vvee are no ſubiectes, they noe ſuperiours.
Is not this ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to contemne and deny all authoritie and
Superioritie? And conſequently, is not this to open the gappe and gate vnto
all mutinie and rebellion? For vvhen the ſubiectes are taught that by
Chriſte and Chriſtian faithe they are freed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce from men and
mens authoritie, if the <pb n="489" facs="tcp:8434:273"/>Prince commaund, they may deny
obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, if hee exacte tributes, taxes and ſubſidies, they may Chuſe
vvhether they vvill pay a peny, and if they like not his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they may
by rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues from him, to vvhome in conſcience and before
God they are not ſubiecte, bicauſe they are free men, vvho in that they are
free can acknovvledge no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Vvho vvill novv blame the ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes in
Fraunce, Flanders and Germanie, for making rebellion? They did but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their doctrine, and in refuſing to obey men, they did but vſe that
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom vvhich Chriſte hathe giuen them, vvhich is to be ſubiect to none.
Yea vvho novve can doe othervviſe then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend rebelles for rebellion,
and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend all loyall ſubiects? Bicauſe in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being and
rebelling they ſhevv them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to bee free men and acknovvledge
Chriſte their Redeemer, and in obeying, they make them ſelues ſubiecte to
men, they vſe not their libertie, and they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to Chriſte, as
thoughe hee had not redeemed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from all ſeruitude of men. If Princes
conſidered vvell this doctrine, they vvould be ſo farre from fauouring
theſe nevve Chriſtians, that they vvould baniſh them their countries. For
vvhat aſſuraunce hathe a Prince of ſubiectes ſo <pb n="490" facs="tcp:8434:274"/>perſvvaded? or hovve can he but allvayes ſtand in feare of their

deſtitute of lavve vvhich is the ſoule and ſinevve vvhich vniteth and

all lavvfull ſuperiours, and conſequently that their lavves do bynde our
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences partelye bicauſe the abſurde ſequele of this doctrine
vvhich by and by ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, ſufficiently confuteth it: nether vvill I
repeate vvhich I haue allready de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, to vvit that obligation of lavves is
nothing repugnant to Chriſtian libertie, <pb n="500" facs="tcp:8434:279"/>bicauſe vvee
are not therfore ſayed to bee freed from the yoke of the lavve bicauſe the
lavve bindeth vs not, but bicauſe vvee haue receiued grace from Chriſte to
full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the lavve and ſo it can no more tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize ouer vs in commaunding
more then vvee are able to performe: I vvill therfore dravve to vvards my
concluſion vvhich is that the alleaged doctrine of Caluin bringeth all lavves
in contempte and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the bridle to all malefactours. And firſt of all
I muſt tell Ihon Caluin that in denying lavves to bynde in conſcience hee
taketh a vvay all lavves, bicauſe it is the eſſence of a lavv to be able
to bynde the ſubiecte, and in this only it differeth from counſale
exhortation and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly Caluin by this doctrine abrogateth all
promiſes and contractes euen of matrimonie vvhich are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler lavves. And
therfore if to ſaye that lavves bynde in conſcience bee to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poile
Chriſte of the honour of a redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and man of Chriſtian libertie, then
is it alſo iniurious to Chriſte and mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to be bound in
conſcience to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe promiſes, and to obſerue contractes, euen vvith
vviues. Thirdly the commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement alſo of parentes and maiſters are
particuler lavves, and conſequently vvee are not bound in conſcience to
obey our <pb n="501" facs="tcp:8434:279"/>maſters, or pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tos, and ſo one of the
ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne commaundementes muſt bee blotted out, bicauſe if vvee bee not bound
to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye our parentes, vvhich is one of the cheefeſte honours vvhich vve can
giue them, vvee are not bound to honour our parentes. Yea by this doctrine it
follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth that the tenne commaundementes bynde vs not in conſcience: vvhich
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe our aduerſaries vvill not ſticke to graunte, as vvee ſhall ſee
in the nexte booke, yet vvhoe ſeethe not vvith vvhat abſurditie? Laſtly
at the leaſt, vvhich yet is not the leaſt abſurditie, this doctrine
bringeth all lavves in contempte: for as the vvilde and vnbroken colte litle
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth if you ſhould tye him vvith heares or threedes, bicauſe hee
knovveth that ſuche ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des are not of force to hold him, ſo vvhen men are
once perſuaded that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves of Princes bynde them not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, they
vvill make litle ſcrouple to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe them, and ſo lavves are
brought into contempte. And although feare of the penaltie or puniſhement
vvhich the lavv layeth on them, may make them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metymes to keepe them for
feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement, Yet vvhen they can eſcape the miniſters of
iuſtice eyes, or handes, or auoid by ſubtile ſhifte or open force the
payne of the lavve, they vvill make noe <pb n="502" facs="tcp:8434:280"/>ſcruple of
tranſgreſſing the lavve; for vvhy ſhould they make conſcience of that
vvhich toucheth not conſcience. But Caluin vvill ſaye that they ought
not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvithſtanding to keepe lavves for order ſake and for auoiding of
offence. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I aſke Caluin vvhat hee meaneth vvhen he ſayeth that they
ought to keepe the lavve? ether hee meaneth by thoſe vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des an obligation
in conſcience vnder payne of ſinne, and then it follovveth (vvhich Caluin
vvill not graunte) that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vves bynde in conſcience: or elſe he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
only a congruitie or decencie, and then it follovveth ſtill that lavves are
brought in contempte. For if once a man bee perſuaded that it is only
conuenient but not neceſſarie to keepe the lavve, hee needeth to make no
ſcruple to tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the lavve, bicauſe the tranſgreſſion is
no ſinne but only an incongruitie. And ſo if this doctrine bee true men
vvill not care a ſtravve for the Princes lavves. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſe ſubiectes,
mutinous ſouldiours, ſtubborne children, crooked ſeruauntes, may bee

bicauſe no man is bound to keep touche and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vvith another?
For if lavves bynd not, promiſes and contractes, not only in lending and
borrovving, buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <pb n="507" facs="tcp:8434:282"/>but alſo in marying,
are not of force to bynd our conſciences, bicauſe they are but particuler
lavves: or if they are more forcible in bynding then lavves, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
Caluin, Chriſte is noe perfecte Redeemer, bicauſe he hath not freed vs from
the bondage of promiſes, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines, vvhich not vvith ſtanding are noe
lavves of Princes, but particuler lavves of particuler men, made betvvixte man
and man for more aſſured conuerſation. And ſo the vvife may iuſtly
fear leaſt her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band vvhen hee is vveary of her, or liketh better of
another, may ſhake her of &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorſe him ſelfe from her. For vvhy
maye hee not? If lavves of Princes bynde not in conſcience, then the
contracte of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, vvhich is but a particuler lavv, can take noe hold of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and ſo by the libertie vvhich Caluin giueth him, vvhich is to
be free in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all lavves, hee may leaue his vvife vvhen, and as
ofte as hee vvill, and as often may hee take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if his vvife
complaine that hee keepeth not promiſe vvith her; he may anſvver her
eaſilie, that if he bee not bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde in conſcience to keepe Gods la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve, hee
is not bounde to keepe the lavve of matrimonie, vvhich is but a particuler
lavve. And if ſhee replve that god alſo commaundeth vs to keepe this
particuler <pb n="508" facs="tcp:8434:283"/>lavve and contracte, hee may tell her that hee
confeſſeth it to bee true, but Caluin hathe aſſured him that Chriſte
hathe freed him in conſcience from all obligation of all lavves, vvhether
they bee humaine or diuine, and ſoe hee is not bound to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe the lavve of
matrimonie, and therfore chalenging his libertie, he may leaue his vvife as
lavvfully, and as freely, as if he had neuer made her promiſe, bicauſe noe
lavve, much more noe promiſe, is able to bynde in conſcience. In like
manner let merchauntes vvho vſe to lend mony or to ſell of truſte and
credit, looke better about them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hether to they haue doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. For if noe
lavves binde in conſcience, then contractes alſo bynde not, and ſo their
debters may chalenge the libertie vvhich Caluin hathe giuen them, vvhich is not
to bee bound in conſcience to pay them a penye. Vvee muſt henceforthe
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take heed not only of knovven thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and murderers, but of them
alſo that go for honeſt men, yea euen of our nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and deareſt
freinds, for vvhat ſhould vvith-hold them from doing vs a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe, if
noe lavv nether of God, nor man, nor nature, bynd them in conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce? And
ſo the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes may diſtruſte their children, and the children their
parentes, bicauſe according to Caluins opinion, the <pb n="509" facs="tcp:8434:283"/>one
is not bound to the other nether by the lavve of God nor nature. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
muſt liue allvvayes in iealouſie of his vvife, and ſhee of him, bicauſe
the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve of matrimonie according to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, bynds not one partie in
conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, to keepe touch vvith the other. And ſo by this doctrine noe
man in any thing can truſte on rely or another, but all muſt liue in feare
iealouſie and ſuſpicion of others, and ſo they muſt forſake
ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and flye to mountaines, and truſte ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beaſts vvhome

vnlavvfull, vvhich are ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in all common vvelthes? Vvhy maye

                  <note place="margin">Pſal 118.</note> They anſvver that vve

But ſay they, he that ſerueth for revvard, vvould not ſerue god if

vvhy vvee abſteine at leaſt from the out vvard acte of ſinne, and if the
mynde bee euill diſpoſed, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not from the fear of hell, but
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an euill diſpoſition. Yea if feare of hell bee ſufficient to keep vs
from the acte of ſinne, it is ſufficient alſo to reſtraine vs from the
euill deſire of the mynde, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe againſt that alſo hell is prepared.
And in this is a plaine differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betvvixte feare of hell and temporall
puniſhments: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Princes by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall paines puniſhe only the

outvvard acte, but alſo the invvard affection and deſire of ſinne, and
therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, if feare of hell keep a man from thefte, it vvill reſtraine him

hell are verye laudable and good, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are bridles to reſtraine
men from ſinning. Vvherfore to dravve neare a concluſion, vvhich is that
our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in taking avvay hope of heauen and feare of hell, open the gappe
to all vice: I reporte mee vnto the indifferente reader hovve the Churche is
like to flouriſhe in vertue vvithout hope of heauen, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of hell,
ſeing that as is proued, noe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <pb n="524" facs="tcp:8434:291"/>vvelthe can enioy
temporall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil peace and diſcipline vvithout them. Takeavvay hope of

iuſtice, mercy and charitie, vvill decay; in breefe men vvill bee negligent
and ſlouthfull in all exerciſe of vertue and obſeruation of the lavve.
For vvho vvill ronne that ſees no gole? vvho vvill fight that hopes for no
victorie? vvho vvill vvorke that lookes for noe revvard. I knovv that the very
loue of God, yea of vertue ſhould moue vs to good, but yet ſo dull vve are,
and ſo backvvard, that theſe motiues litle moue vs, and ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnto

fevv vvould ſtriue to ouer come their paſſions, and the difficultie in
exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of vertue, and obſeruation of the commaundementes. Like vviſe
if feare bee the keeper, praeſeruer, and conſeruer of all common vvelthes,
hovve ſhall vve imagin that the Church of God can ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vvithout it? I
graunte that ſinne is ſo fovvle a thinge that euen for the hatred of
ſinne, vvee ſhould abandone ſinne, but ſeing that ſinne is ſo
aggreable to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and neuer appeareth in the

are vvho vvould abſteine from ſinne for the turpitude therof &amp;
diſhoneſtie vvhich it implyethe. For vvhat ſhould reſtraine a man from
ſinne? ſhame of the vvorld? I ſuppoſe he hathe a ſecret place. Feare
of temporall puniſhment, I ſuppoſe the fault bee vnknovven? Feare of God?
Vvho vvill feare God that feares not the hell, vvhich hee hathe prepared?
Vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if notvvithſtanding the hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and feare of hell (vvhich
for all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins hereſie poſſeſſeth the hartes of moſte men) yet
ſo fevv liue vprightly and ſo many go avvrye, vvhat vvould they do, if hope
of heauen, and fear of hell vvere quite rooted out of their myndes? Truly the
narrovv path of vertue vvould bee ouergrovvne vvith vveeds, for vvante of
treading, and the broad vvay of vice vvould become ſo ſmothe, that none
vvould imbrace vertue, all vvould tumble headlonge into the depthe of vice, and
pleaſure: and ſo the vvay to vertue vvould bee hedged vp, and the gate and
vvay to vice vvould allvvayes lie open, heauen vvould be a place
inacceſſible, and hell our common home.</p>

vvorkes of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve, vvhich is all one as if hee had ſayed, that a man is
iuſtified by faithe only, and not by good vvorkes. But to this I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvere
that if ſainct Paule had ſayed, that a man is iuſte by faithe and not by
vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, adding noe more, then Luther had had ſome argument, but hee
ſayeth not ſoe, but only, that a man is iuſte by fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and not by the

our dutie by faithe, and another thing to doe our dutie. Yea if there vvere no

that they haue true faithe, and yet liue moſt viciouſly, it vvould
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them that faithe (if there bee any in them) may bee ſeuered from
good vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and ioyned vvith euil. But to come to a concluſion, if faith
only iuſtifie then it follovveth that the gappe is opened vnto all vice and
villanie. For vvhen they come to the definition of this faithe vvhich on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iuſtifieth, 
<note place="margin">Supra.</note> they ſay that it is an
aſſurau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce by vvhich vvee are fully perſuaded that Chriſtes iuſtice
is ours, by vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> faith, alſo they ſaye, Chriſtes iuſtice is ſo
applyed vnto vs, that it is ours and couerethe our ſinnes, and maketh vs
appear iuſte in the ſight of God. Out of vvhich doctrine I deduce this
argumente. If faith only iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie then if vvee retaine that faithe, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe
vve commit all the villanies in the vvorlde, they can not hurte vs, bicauſe
ſo longe as vvee hold that faithe vvee are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte, and ſo the gappe is
opened to all vice. For if a man bee once perſuaded, that faithe only
iuſtifiethe, and that this faithe is noe other thinge but an apprehenſion
that Chriſtes iuſtice is ours, if hee perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de him ſelfe that
Chriſtes iuſtice is his (as <pb n="534" facs="tcp:8434:296"/>hee muſt, bicauſe
Caluin and Luther af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that euery man muſt beleeue ſo if hee vvilbe a
Chriſtian) then needs hee only care to retaine that faithe and
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. For if that only iuſtifie, then retaining that, hee is
aſſured that he is ſtill iuſte, though hee commit all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in
the vvorld, and ſo by this doctrine he hathe good leaue to ſinne. And for
more confirmation of this argument it muſt be noted, that Luther and Caluin
affirme that Chriſtes iuſtice is the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of all men, and that if all
men bee not iuſte by it, the reaſon is bicauſe by faithe they doe not
apprehend it, if then the greateſt ſinner in the vvorld do vppon a
ſodaine apprehend that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes iuſtice is his then is, hee iuſtified
vvithout any other paenaunce from all his former ſinnes, and if hee holde

may launce into a Sea of ſinne and iniquitie, and neuer feare drovvning,

they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, and ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in plain termes one againſt another. Nether
is this doctrine oppoſite only to <pb n="544" facs="tcp:8434:301"/>ſcripture, but
alſo to reaſon. For firſt there are many corners in a mans conſcience,
vvhich vve ſeeldom or neuer looke into: For as Hieremie ſayeth, 
<note place="margin">C. <hi>17.</hi>
                  </note> the harte of man is
vnſearchable, and lyeth open only to God. hovve then can Caluin by faith be
aſſured that his ſinnes are forgiuen, that hee is iuſte and elect? or
if hee knovv, god only is not the ſearcher of harts. And if ther be many
corners in mans harte, to vvhich the harte it ſelfe is not priuie,
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture after all our ſeeking, ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne may lurke in a corner
vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> vve knovv not of. Secondly by Caluins ovvn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, vve muſt
beleeue nothing but vvhat vvee finde in ſcripture, and vvhere fyndes he, that
Caluin is iuſte, or that his ſinnes are forgiuen? If hee finde it not, hee
raſhly beleeueth it. If hee ſayeth that Chriſte is our redemption and
propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I anſvvere that ſo hee is the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and propitiation
of all, and yet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes and infidels and many of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are not
iuſte, and therfore muſt not beleeue aſſuredly that they are iuſte or
ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cte, &amp; if they ſhould they ſhould beleeue that vvhich is not ſo.
Chriſt therfore is our propitiation, bicauſe hee hathe payed by his
paſſion a ſufficient price for our iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and redemption, but
yet if that price by faithe in Chriſte, together vvith <pb n="545" facs="tcp:8434:301"/>hope, charitie, Sacramentes, and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lavve (for all
theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded) bee not applyed to vs, vve are neuer a vvhit the
better. Thirdly ſuppoſe only Caluins faithe by vvhich he beleeues Chriſts
iuſtice to be his (vvhich not vvith ſtanding is allready refuted) vvere
ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to applie this propitiation; 
<note place="margin">Supra.</note> yet for as much as Caluin
ſayeth that good vvorkes do neceſſarily follovve a found faithe, I
demaund of him vvhether that he and his haue not iuſte cauſe to doubte, or
at le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt to feare their ovvne iuſtice, and faithe alſo, vvhoſe euill
deeds are ſo many, and ſo manifeſte. Fourthly euery one of them ſayeth
hee is aſſured that hee is iuſte and ſhalbe ſaued, &amp; yet ſome
of them are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, bicauſe ſome of them haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie faithes, and
ſome of the ſame faithe are damned, vvhy then may not Caluin alſo feare
leaſt hee bee deceued, ſeing that Chriſts dyed for all, and yet all are
not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte nor elect, thoughe they aſſure then ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the ſame.
Laſtly this doctrine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the gapp to all manner of vice and vvickednes.
For if it bee ſufficient to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification to beleeue vndoubtedly that I
ame iuſte, or that Chriſtes iuſtice, is mine, then dothe it follovv that
as after I haue ſinned I may apprehend Chriſtes iuſtice to bee myne, and
my ſelfe to bee iuſtified <pb n="546" facs="tcp:8434:302"/>by the ſame, ſoe vvhen
I ame moued to ſinne by the deuil or my ovvne concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, yea euen then
vvhen I ame in the acte of ſinne, I may apprehend that thoughe ther is noe
goodneſſe in me of myne ovvne, yet Chriſtes iuſtice is myne, of vvhich,
if euen in the acte of ſinne, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe, I maye aſſure my
ſelfe alſo, that noe ſinne can hurte mee, bicauſe that aſſurau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
iuſtifieth mee. And ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catour may thus diſcourſe vvith him
ſelfe. I confeſſ (ô Lord) that there is no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in me, and that
this acte to vvhich I ame novv tempted is a ſinne, but Chriſtes iuſtice
is myne if I vvill apprehend it ſo, am I ame iuſte if I vvill beleeue ſo,
and from this faithe, I vvill neuer bee diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but vvill hold it
faſte euen in the acte of ſinne, and ſo I need not feare this ſinne,
bicauſe if I hold faſt by this faithe, noe ſinne can hurte mee, bicauſe
by this fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the I me iuſtified. And ſo the vvay is open to all vice and
vvickednes, bicauſe if a man vvill beleeue that he is iuſte, and hold
faſte by this faith, noe ſinne can hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te him, bicauſe that

<hi>Vvhoſoeuer out of Chriſte vvorketh, prayeth, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth; dothe vvorke,
pray and ſuffer in vaine: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvhat ſoeuer is not of faith, is
ſinne.</hi> And in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation of Latomus reaſon, thus he ſpeaketh:
<hi>Omne opus bonum peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt niſi ignoſcat Dei miſericordea: euery
good vvorke is a ſinne, vnleſs Gods mercie forgiue it.</hi> And in the
ſame place, hee ſayeth that God pardons it, in that he imputeth it not to
the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And a litle before that, hee ſayeth that ſainct Paule neuer
did good vvorke in his life, &amp; that the beſt vvhich euer he did, vvas a
ſinne, though God imputed it not to him, bicauſe he vvas faithfull. And yet
again before that, he ſayeth that euen our iuſtice is vncleanes, and all
our good <pb n="550" facs="tcp:8434:304"/>vvorkes are ſinnes. Likevviſe in one of his
propoſitions collected and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the famous vniuerſitie of Paris,
he hath theſe very vvords: <hi>Omnes virtutes morales, &amp; ſcientiae
ſpeculatiuae, non ſunt verae virtutes &amp; ſcientiae, ſed peccata
&amp; errores: all morall vertues and ſpeculatiue ſciences, are not true
vertues and ſciences, but ſinnes and errours.</hi> Ihon Caluin although he
vvill ſeeme to make a difference betvvixt the morall vertues,

                  <note place="margin">l 3 c 14 ſect. 7.9.11.</note> Yea the ſame
ſentence hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth not only againſt the ſinfull, but alſo the
iuſte and faithfull Chriſtian; to vvit, that no good proceedeth from ether
of them, but that the beſt vvorke vvhich the iuſteſt man dothe,
deſerueth ſhame &amp; damnation. The reaſon and ground of this their
doctrine is bicauſe they thinke that original ſinne hathe ſo defaced our
nature, that it hath blotted out the image of God, bereaued vs of free vvill,
encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our nature vvholly to ſinne, vnabled it to vertue, in ſo much
that vvhat ſoeuer proceedeth from this infected nature, is filthy,
abominable, and odiouſe in the ſight of God. But thus they firſt of all
doe mightie iniurie vnto mans nature, vvhich by this doctrine is rather
brutiſ he then reaſonable. For if mans vnderſtanding bee ſo
metamorphized, that all his ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and knovvledge ether ſpeculatiue or
practicall is errour and deceipte, as Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſayeth, I ſee not vvhy man
ſhould bee counted reaſonable, more then a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te beaſte. And if hee bee
vvholly bente to ſenſualitie and ſinne, and hathe noe 
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:8434:305"/>inclination to vertue, noe povvver nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to do
the leaſt acte of vertue, or to reſiſte the leaſt tentation, then is
his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture noe more noble then the nature of a beaſt, bicauſe he is
altogether ſenſual as a beaſt is, and no more enclined to vertue or able
to doe a vertuouſe action then an oxe or an aſſe. And ſo the olde
definition by vvhich philoſophers vſe to define man muſt bee corrected,
bicauſe they define a man to be <hi>animal rationale a reaſonable
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> vvhich definition by this doctrine aggreeth noe more to a man
then to a beaſt, bicauſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as vnable to the vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and operations of
reaſon as a beaſt is, and ſo is noe more ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but a beaſt by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins
definition. Secondly this doctrine condemneth all Philoſophers and
Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, vvhich teach vs, that in the moſt vitious man that is, there
are ſome incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations &amp; ſeedes of vertue, vvhich is the cauſe that
the moſt vvicked man that is, loueth vertue at leaſt in others, hathe a
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience vvhen hee hathe done euil, bluſheth at his euill
deedes as not beſeeming his nature, and ſome ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes dothe ſome good
vvorke or other: for you ſhall hardly finde a man giuen to all vice, and
enclined to noe vertue. from hence proceeded the morall vvorkes of the
Romaines, for vvhich ſainct Auſtine <pb n="553" facs="tcp:8434:305"/>ſayeth
allmightie God beſtovved on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 
<note place="margin">l. 5 cin. c. 15.</note> ſo ample en empire,
and honoured them vvith ſo many victories, hence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo the lavves
of Licurgus, Solon, Plato, and the reſt, and all the motall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes and
vertues, of the ancientes. from hence alſo proceed the ſpeculatiue
ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of naturall Philoſophie, Metaphyſike, Mathematique,
Aſtrologie, and ſuche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke: vvhich to condemne of errour, as Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dothe, is meare madneſſe: againſt vvhome I vvill vſe the ſame
argument, vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Philoſophers vſed againſt the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demikes vvho denyed
all ſcience: ether Luther knovveth that all ſpeculatiue and practicall
ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces are errours, or hee knov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not: if hee knovve not, hee is raſhe
to deny ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, if he knovve, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in denying ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hee grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth
ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And although I vvill not deny but that the vertues of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes are
many tymes vice, bicauſe their ende or ſcope is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times vaine glorie,
or elſe ſome other euill circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtaunce is anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed. Yet to ſaye that
all their actions are of neceſſitie ſinnes, is to make man no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I
haue proued. I vvill graunt alſo that ſinners good vvorkes, as prayer,
almes deedes, and ſuch like, are <hi>opera mortua</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad vvorkes, as
diuines ſaye, bicauſe in that they proceed not from ye life of grace, they
are not condignely meritoriouſe, <pb n="554" facs="tcp:8434:306"/>yet they may be
morally good, and if they proceed from a good intention, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God
vvhich is called grace preue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is neuer vvanting, they
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man to penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to
iuſtification. Vvherfore although Nabuchodonoſor vvas in mortall ſinne, 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan</hi> 4.</note> yet Daniel counſayled
him to redeeme his ſinnes by almes deedes, vvhich co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unſaile he vvould
neuer haue giuen, if to giue almes, had beene a mortall ſinne. Thirdly this
is to condemne Scripture yea and God him ſelfe, vvho forbid cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine actions
as euil, and counſaile and commaund others as good: vvhich is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdely
done if all bee ſinnes and euil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Fourthly, hence it follovveth that
all ſinnes are aequall: bicauſe if our actions bee euil bicauſe they
proceed from an euill and corrupted nature, they muſt bee (at leaſt in this
reſpecte) equally euill, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the frutes of a crabbe tree are of like
ſovvernes, bicauſe they proceed from the ſame tree, and take their
ſovvernes from the ſame ſappe. Laſtly thus the gappe is open vnto all
vice. For if vvhat ſoeuer man dothe is ſinne, then if hee bee temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to
fornication, to vvhat purpoſe ſhould hee refrayne? For if hee reſiſte
the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hee muſt do it ether by chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his body, or by
prayer, or by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <pb n="555" facs="tcp:8434:306"/>reſolution of the mynde and
vvill, vvhich if it bee ſinne alſo, hee auoydeth one ſinne by another,
and ſo might as vvel haue yeelded to the temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And if he hee haue
another mans vvife in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or his landes, or goodes in
poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hee can not get out of this ſinne but by reſtoring,
bicauſe the ſinne is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen vnleſſe the thinge vvhich is
vvro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully holden bee reſtored, and yet to vvhat purpoſe ſhould hee
reſtore, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring alſo bee a ſinne, as it muſt bee, if all our
actions bee ſinnes? truly he hathe litle reaſon, bicauſe in reſtoring
hee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not ſinne, but chaungeth one ſinne for another. Yea if this
doctrine may take place, the Prince may as vvell vſe oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his
ſubiectes as bountie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence; ſubiectes may as vvell rebell as

bicauſe the vnderſtanding iudgeth none in particuler neceſſarie, and

And in this may be ſeen a differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betvvixte men and brute beaſtes,

Laſtly ther vvas neuer yet any nation ſo barbarouſe vvhich confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

reiecteth free vvill. Is it ſoe? and are ſcriptures contrarie to reaſon?
I vvill not deny but ſcripture teacheth many thinges aboue reaſon, but that
it teacheth any thinge againſt reaſon, is moſte vntrue. For as grace
perfiteth nature in eleuating it to a higher being, and to more heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

leadeth reaſon farther then of her ſelfe ſhee could goe, but induceth her
not to any thing vvhich is againſt reaſon, for ſo God vvhich is the
autour of reaſon and faithe, in ruinating reaſon by faith and ſcripture,
ſhould denye him ſelfe, bicauſe he ſhould be contrary to him ſelfe.
Yea if Scripture ſhould deny freevvill, it ſhould be contrarie to it
ſelfe, bicauſe it giueth as plaine teſtimony for it, as for any thing.

abſurditie follovveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If man haue no freevvill all vice and
vvickedneſſe muſt goe for currant, and no man muſt endeuour to auoid
ſinne, bicauſe he hathe no povver to auoid it. Be it then that Maiſter
Miniſter dehorte me from vice vvith all the Rhetorick vvhich he hathe, let
him lay before myne eyes the filthines of ſinne, the diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie vvhich
it implyeth, the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God the ſcandale of my neighbour vvhich
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth it, therby to diſſuade me from it; yet if I haue no freevvil
nor povver to auoid ſinne, I may anſvvere him that his perſuaſions are
but lippe-labour vvhich he might as vvel vſe to a beaſt as to a man; For,
vvhat I ſhall do, that of neceffitie I ſhall doe; and as hee diſuadeth me
from vice, ſo the pleaſure or temporall profit <pb n="569" facs="tcp:8434:313"/>vvhich
vice bringeth, doth ſo allure me, and the deuil ſo vrgeth me, that I can
not reſiſte, bicauſe I haue no free vvill, but muſt behaue my ſelfe
paſſiuely, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting concupiſcence and the deuil to vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke in me vvhat
they vvill, bicauſe I haue no povver to reſiſte them. For as a man that
is perſuaded that he hathe noe force to reſiſte his enemie, or the
Miniſters of iuſtice, layeth dovvne his armes and vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apons, and permitteth
them to do their pleaſure, knovving that reſiſtaunce is vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, vvhen
vvill he nill he, their pleaſure muſt be doone; ſo vvhen a man is
perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he hathe no freevvill nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver to auoide ſinne, he

And if any man rebuke him for his ſinnes, or if God herafter at the day of

an accuſation, and a tricke in ſtore to auoid ſuch a condemnation, to
vvit, that he could do no othervviſe, bicauſe he had no free vvill. And
ſo he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit vvhat ſinnes he vvill and no man, yea not God him ſelfe
can iuſtly finde fault vvith him, vnleſs they firſt finde a fault in
Luthers and Caluins doctrine, vvhich <pb n="570" facs="tcp:8434:314"/>teacheth him that

that the gappe is opened to all vice and vvickednes. For if a man bee once

perſvvaded that hee can not keepe the Sabothe, as <pb n="571" facs="tcp:8434:314"/>hee
ſhould doe. And if hee once giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to Caluin that hee can not obſerue
the lavve, vvhich forbiddeth him to couet his neighbours vvife or goods, if hee
bee tempted or moued vvith ſuche obiectes, hee vvill neuer vrge him ſelfe

couet and deſire, but alſo inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatelye vſe his neighbours vvife and

tranſgreſſion of one lavve or other, hee that is perſuaded that hee can
not fullfill any lavve of God (as all Lutheranes and Caluiniſtes are) is
perſuaded alſo that hee can auoid noe ſinne, and conſequently if any
ſinne moue or allure him ether by profit or pleaſure vvhich it implyeth,
hee can not, being ſo perſuaded, endeuour to vvithſtande the temptation,
bicauſe that vvere to ſhevve him ſelfe able to reſiſte ſinne and to

                  <p>The ninth Chapter proueth that in affirming God to be the

               </argument>
               <p>I Haue already related the blaſphemies of our nevv
Chriſtians againſt the goodnes of God, and I haue demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they
are ſenſeles, abſurd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, <pb n="575" facs="tcp:8434:316"/>in making God
the autour of our ſinnes, vvhoſe mercie pardoneth, and vvhoſe iuſtice
puniſhethe ſinnes, but can not vvorke, or commit the leaſt ſinne
vvithout preiudice of his goodneſſe and deitie alſo, vvhich is goodnes it
ſelfe. So that novve I vvill ſuppoſe for my premiſes that they are of
that opinion, and I vvill deducefor my intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that this
doctrine looſeth the bridle vnto all iniquitie. For if a man be once
perſuaded as all Caluiniſtes are, that God is the autour and vvorker of his
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vvhat is ther remaining to reſtrayne and vvith-hold him from
ſinne? he may and vvill eaſily diſcourſe thus vvith him ſelfe, vvhen
ſoeuer the deuil vrgeth, or the fleſh allurethe, or the vvorld intiſeth
him to ſinne. This acte to vvhich I ame tempted and vvhich commonly is called
a ſinne, is the vvorke of God as vvell as myne, and more his then myne,
bicauſe as my oracle, (that is Ihon Caluin) tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me, he vvorketh it in
me, and vrgeth me vnto it. Vvhy then ſhould I ether be a frayed or aſhamed
to do that vvhich God not only dothe vvith me, but alſo ſo forcibly moueth
mee vnto it, that (as M. Caluin telleth me) I can not poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte
him? Ame I better then he? or can any ſinne be ſo vglye, as not to
beſeeme <pb n="576" facs="tcp:8434:317"/>me vvhich beſeemeth him, vvho is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it
ſelfe? But peraduenture God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth vvith him ſelfe but not vvith
me, and therfore vvill not haue me to ſinne. Vvill he not? Vvhy then dothe he
vrge and egge me to ſinne? vvhere I ame vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, certes I ame vvilled, and
vvilled by him by vvhom I ame vrged. Yea if ſinne be the vvorke of God (as it
is vnleſs Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin lye) then is it the effect of his vvill (for as Dauid
ſayeth hee dothe all by his vvill, and as diuines ſay his povver is his
vvill) and ſo I in ſining ſhall do his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and conforme my
ſelfe to his vvill. Let vs ſinne then freely, vvee do but Gods vvill, and
let vs not make ſcruple of that, of vvhich hee is the vviller and vvorker,
let vs not bluſhe at the turpitude of ſinne of vvhich God him ſelfe is

lavvfull and pleaſing to God, bicauſe they are the vvorkes of his vvill,
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently according to his vvill. But fye rather vppon this impious
and licentious doctrine, God forbiddeth ſinne by his lavve, and therfore
vvould not haue it done, and hee puniſheth ſinne moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerily, and

if noe lavv bynd vs in conſcience, noe ſinne at all can bee found in our

they denye free-vvill and conſequently they take avvay all vice and vertue.
For if vvhen I do that action vvhich is counted a ſinne I haue noe
free-vvill, then I can do no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervviſe, if I can do noe othervviſe, I ame
not to bee blamed for that, vvhich I could not auoyed, but rather to bee

to the poore I can do no othervviſe, (as I can not if I haue noe free-vvill)
I ame not pravſe vvorthe, bicauſe noe God a mercie to him that dothe vvell

leſſe, by hovv much greater vvas the conſtrainte; vvhich is a ſigne
that free choiſe, more or leſſe, is neceſſary to the making of a
vertuouſe action. Thirdly they ſay that God imputeth no ſinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a
faithfull man, vvhence it follovveth that there is noe ſinne in their
actions, or that God is deceiued, or is noe right eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of thinges; but
this they vvill not ſaye <pb n="582" facs="tcp:8434:320"/>and therfore muſt auouch
that there is noe ſinne in Chriſtians actions. Fourthly although herin they
ſpeake not vvith that conſequence vvhich might haue beene expected of men
of reaſon, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that all our actions euen thoſe that go for
beſt, are of them ſelues mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vvhich deſerue no better
revvard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eternall damnation; vvhich if it be true, thence muſt needs
follovve, that there is not any vertue in our actions, bicauſe vvhere vice
is, vertue can not bee: and ſo vertue vvhich proceedeth not but <hi>ex
inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra cauſa, from an intier cauſe,</hi> is cleane taken avvay. Fiftely
they affirme that God is the autour of all our ſinnes, and ſeing that his
vvill is his power, by vvhich he cauſeth all thinges, ſinne is according to
his vvill: yea they affirme that he moueth vs &amp; eggeth vs to ſinne,
vvhich is a ſigne that hee vvill haue vs ſinne. If ſinne then hee
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God his vvill, it can not offend him, but rather pleaſe him,
bicauſe the vve are pleaſed vvhen thinges do fall out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our
vvill and deſire; and ſeing that vvhere noe offence is there can bee noe
ſinne, it follovvethe, that if God bee the authour of ſinne, then ſinne
is noe ſinne at all. Out of theſe opinions I gather that nether ſinne nor
vertue is remaining in mens actions, and conſequently if this 
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:8434:320"/>doctrine bee true, noe man needeth to feare ſinne or to
care for vertue, bicauſe this vvord, vertue, is but a vvorde vvhich hath no

&amp; vvraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, vvho ronne and ſtriue for a gole, crovvne, or revvard.
So that our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo conſiſteth in action, labour and
operation. And truly vvhoe conſidereth hovve vnvvorthy a man idlenes is,
vvill neuer dreame that in it ſhould conſiſte a Chriſtians perfection.
For idlenes is the mother of all vice, &amp; the very bane of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and no
leſſe pernicious to mans ſoule and body alſo, then it is to the grounde
of the gardener or huſband man. For as the earth not tilled nor laboured,
bringes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the nothing but vveedes, as the tree not pruned beares nought but
leaues, and at the length not ſo much as leaues; ſo if by continuall
exerciſe of vertue, and good vvorkes, the ſeed-plotte of our ſoule bee
not continually manured and tilled, the ſeede of Gods inſpirations &amp;
inclinations to vertue, vvhich are neuer vvanting in our ſoule, bring for the
noe frute of good vvorkes and vertuouſe actions, but only the breres,
brambles and vveedes of vices do ouergrovv the ſoule. And as the poole 
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:8434:332"/>that ſtandeth and moueth vvith noe ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
ſtinketh, and engendrethe nothing elſe but frogges, ſnakes &amp;
ſerpents, ſo the ſoule of man vvhich is allvvayes idle and vnoccupied and
neuer moued vvith the exerciſe of vertue, putrifieth in her ovvn corruption,
and bringeth forthe nothing but monſtrouſe vices. Truly vvhen man is idle
he is vnarmed and expoſed to all danger. Then the deuil takers his tyme, the
fleſhe aſlaultes him, the vvorld mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes him, and he becomes ſlaue
&amp; captiue to them all bicauſe by operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he makes no reſiſtaunce.
And vvhereas much hurte hath proceeded from idleneſſe, neuer yet any
exploit or entrepriſe vvorthy a man. Hence proceed fornications, adulteries,
robberies, for vvhen the mynde is not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in good cogitations it is
occupied in euil, bicauſe it can not be altogether idle but ether it is vvell
or ill occupied. Vvherfore the Poet demaundethe vvhy Aegiſtus became an
adulterer, &amp; he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvereth thus. <hi>In promptu cauſa eſt,

vvhich pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good habits by vvhich our ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is boidled, and our

becomes effeminate, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <pb n="607" facs="tcp:8434:332"/>are vnruly, and the

Cato, bicauſe Cato vvould haue had Carthage deſtroyed, that Rome might
enioy a freer peace and libertie; but Scipio counted it more profitable for
Rome to haue Cathage ſtand, that Rome might haue an enemie to exerciſe her:
vvhich opinion of Scipio, tyme proued trueſt, for vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Carthage vvas
aftervvards ruined, Rome thinking her ſelfe ſecure, became careles and
idle, and the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by idlenes loſt their former force &amp; provves,
and became altogether effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and impotent, ſlaues to ſenſualitie,
vvho before hand beene Lords of the vvorld. And yet according to our nevv
reformers doctrine, idlenes is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and perfection of morall,
and Chriſtian life. For they firſt of all vvill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vs to beleeue that a

that vvhich iuſtifieth, and vvhich is ſufficient to ſaluation, vvithout
good vvorkes, or obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lavve. Vvhich if it be true, Chriſtian
perfection ſhall conſiſte in an abſtracted and idle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of
Chriſtes iuſtice, but in no practiſe nor exerciſe of vertue, in noe
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or good vvorke at all: and ſo vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras all other creaturs attain to
their end <pb n="608" facs="tcp:8434:333"/>by action, motion, and labour, man only by
idlenes, that is by apprehending only, and doing nothing, ſhall purchaſe
his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. The artificer ſhall come to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his arte by

his vvholle life, bicauſe by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall practiſe he augmenteth his ſkill;
but the arte of a Chriſtian ſhall require no practice at all, no labour, no

to make him as iuſte &amp; as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Chriſte him ſelfe, vvho is the

vvhich by maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge is made lavvfull, it is an argument that Chaſtitie is more

bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, vvhich are called pleaſures, but yet ſo are goods and pleaſures

<pb n="619" facs="tcp:8434:338"/>domages and diſpleaſures. Laſtly if to vſe
moderation in eating and drinking, bee a vertue called temperaunce, vvhy
ſhall not a moderation in pleaſurs of the fleſhe and ſenſualitie,
(vvhich vvee call chaſtitie) bee eſteemed alſo as a vertue? But our
Epicurs vvill ſay, that a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in pleaſurs is good, but yet as it is
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavvfull to abſteyne altogether from mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſo is it a ſinne to
renounce all pleaſurs of the body. To this vvee haue an eaſy anſvvere, to
vvit, that the firſt abſtinence is vnlavvfull, bicauſe it killeth the
bodye vvhich can not liue vvithout meate, but the ſecond is lavvfull and
laudable, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe corporall pleaſures are not neceſſary for the bodyes
maintenaunce, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are preiudiciall to the ſoule, and ſometymes to
the body alſo. But yet they haue not doone, it is againſt nature as they
ſaye, &amp; preiudiciall to mankinde to liue chaſtly. I anſvvere that
chaſtitie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of the fleſhe and ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, by
vvhich vve aggree vvith beaſtes, but it is moſt beſeeming our
reaſonable nature, vvhich is the principall parte of man, and ſo is

but neuer after, and this is vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovves chaſtitie. The third is a moderate

is lavvfull and honeſt, bicauſe as matrimonie is lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

<pb n="627" facs="tcp:8434:342"/>leaue her huſband or bee ſtubborne, or litigiouſe,

man.</hi> Vvhich doctrine if it be true, then euery one muſt marry, &amp;
ſo virginitie and vvidovves chaſtitie is exiled the vvorld, crelſe he
muſt take a queane, and ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie is gone. For if it bee as
impoſſible for a man to liue vvithout a vvoman, or for a vvoman to bee
vvithout a man, as for a man not to bee a man, or a vvoman not to bee a vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt the caſe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes happen, that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needs take a
queane, or that the vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needs, haue a man beſides her huſband.
For firſt if the man or vvife be longe from home, ſeing that nether partie
can liue any tyme vvithout a mate, it follovvethe that the vvoman muſt vſe
the helpe of her man or ſome other, and the man muſt vſe his mayd as
Luther ſayeth, or ſome other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vvife, mayd, or daughter; elſe Luthers
and Caluins doctrine is falſe, vvhich teacheth that aman can not liue
vvithout a vvoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor a vvoman vvithout a man. If they anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver that hee maye
liue ſome tyme vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a vvoman, then ſaye I, that it is not as
impoſſible to bee vvithout a vvoman, as not to bee a man, bicauſe in no
tyme is it poſſible for a man not to bee a man. And I ſuppoſe that a
temptation maye happen as vvell in an hovver as in a yeare: vvhat then ſhall
the partie tempted doe? if hee reſiſte, Luther and Caluins doctrine is
falſe, if hee can not reſiſte, then if hee can <pb n="629" facs="tcp:8434:343"/>not
marrye (as many tymes there is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me tyme required to get a vvife) hee muſt
needes haue a Queane. Vvhence it follovveth, that not only merchaunt ventures,
muſt take heed hovve they goe from home, but noblemen alſo muſt not
aduenture to goe ſoe much as a hunting, vnleſſe they locke vp their
vviues, or take them vvith them. Hence it follovveth alſo that vvhen the
vvife is ſicke, eſpecially any tyme, or vvhen ſhee lieth in, the man maye
take a nevve vvife, if hee bee tempted to luſte. For if hee bee tempted hee
can not abſolutely ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that temptation, <hi>ergo</hi> hee muſt haue a
vvoman, but in theſe caſes his vvife vvill not ſerue his turne,
<hi>ergo</hi> he muſt haue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvife; and if hee can not get a vvife,
hee muſt haue a queane: And this alſo in this caſe of ſuch a great
neceſſitie, muſt bee lavvfull for him, bicauſe noe man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in
that vvhich hee can not avoid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is hee to bee blamed but rather pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
for doing that, to vvhich neceſſitie compelled him. And ſeing the vvoman
in this pointe is as frayle yea frayler the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man, being the vveaker ſexe,
ſhee may as often take a nevve huſband, as the man a vvife. Vvhich doctrine
vvhat a vvide ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te it openeth to all diſhoneſtie I leaue it to the gentle

headlong into the depth of ſinne, ſo it holdes them captiues vvith an
impoſſibilitie of riſing vp again, and ſo is vvorthy double

ſuch a paradox? Trulie very eaſily and that vvithout ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning farre for an
ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. If you remember they are of opinion that the only vvay for a
ſinner to ariſe vp again after he is fallen by ſinne, is to beleeue
aſſuredly vvithout all doubte or ſtaggering, that hee is iuſt, &amp;

impoſſible for a ſinner to beleeue, ſhall proue alſo that by their
doctrine, it is impoſſible for a ſinner to bee iuſtified or to ariſe
from the lovve fall of ſinne to the highe and eminent ſtate of grace. To
proue this I vvill only ſuppoſe one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Maxime of Philoſophie,
to vvit that truthe and veritie, or at leaſt ſome probable apparau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

veritie. And this is the cauſe vvhy vve can not beleeue &amp; ſaye vvith
harte, that blacke is vvhite, or that a knovvn falſitie is a veritie, as I
haue declared in my Epiſtle to the reader more at large. Out of theſe
premiſſes I gather this concluſion: that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a
ſinner, to frame on a ſodayne this aſſent, that hee is iuſt, and
conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly, if this bee the only vvaye for a ſinner to riſe vnto
iuſtification, it is impoſſible for him after hee is fallen by ſinne,
to riſe againe by iuſtification, and ſo vvhere the tree falleth, there it
muſt lye. For as it is impoſſible for a ſicke manne (if hee bee in his
vvittes) to beleeue veryly that hee is vvholle, vnleſſe hee ſee ſome
alteration in him ſelfe, and finde ſome eaſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſo is
it as impoſſible for a ſinner vvho is ſpirituallie ſicke, yea dead,
vppon a ſodaine to beleeue (eſpecially ſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly as Caluin vvill
haue him) that hee is iuſte, vvhole, and ſounde, and fully reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of
his ſpiritual diſeaſe, vnleſſe hee <pb n="635" facs="tcp:8434:346"/>ſee ſome
alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him ſelfe before hee frame ſo firme an aſſent. For I
vvill aſke of Caluin vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee commethe freſhe from this vilanie, vvhat
moueth him to this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and beleefe that hee is iuſt, and elect? hathe
he a reuelation? or haue euerie one of his follovvers vvhom he vvill haue to
beleeue the ſame, any illumination from God by vvhich they are acertained?
hee muſt needs ſay noe, bicauſe they experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them ſelues that
they haue no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che euidence: finde they any contrition, or loue of God, or
haue they any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent grace in them, vvhich hathe altered them and made them
of ſinners, iuſte, and holy? They vvill ſay noe, for then faithe ſhould
not iuſtifie, but that vvhich goeth before this faithe. And this they muſt
needes ſay, bicauſe faithe is the firſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in vs, and vvith them it
is the firſt and only thinge vvhich iuſtifieth; yea in their opinion,
contrition vvhich is inherrent in vs, can not be our Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe
they ſaye that there is noe inherent grace nor iuſtice. And if before this
faythe of theirs, God ſhould by infuſion of grace iuſtifie them, yet
vnleſſe they had a reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they could not, eſpecially vvith ſuch
aſſuraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce beleeue it, bicauſe the vnderſtanding can not giue
aſſent vvithout ſome appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unce of truthe. They vvill ſaye that
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes <pb n="636" facs="tcp:8434:347"/>iuſtice is theirs, ſo that they vvill
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it by faith, and ſo they are iuſt by that iuſtice if they
vvill beleeue ſo. but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvill this ſhifte ſerue their turne. For
before they beleeue this, Chriſtes iuſtice muſt bee theirs, and by it
they muſt bee iuſte, bicauſe that is the obiecte of their beleefe, and
the vnderſtanding muſt ſee it to bee ſo, before ſhee beleeue ſoe;
vvherfore ſeing that before this faithe of theirs, Chriſtes iuſtice is
not theirs, and they alſo are not yet iuſte, it follovvethe that they can
not, ſo longe as they are in their vvittes beleeue that they are iuſte,
bicauſe this veritie muſt appeare to the vnderſtanding before ſhee can
beleeue it; and therfore if before faithe they bee not iuſte, they can neuer
beleeue ſo. For as the ſicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt bee vvholle and ſound before hee
can beleeue that hee is ſo, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not in his povver to beleeue
that vvhich is not, or vvhich at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not, ſoe a ſinner can
not on a ſodaine (vnleſſe hee haue ſome reaſon for it) beleeue
aſſurdly that hee is iuſt. And therfore if this aſſured faith bee
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ariſe after our fall taken by ſinne, it is
impoſſible to riſe again, after that vvee are fallen. And to make the
matter yet more playne; as if the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for a ſicke man to recouer
his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>althe, <pb n="637" facs="tcp:8434:347"/>vvere to beleeue that hee is vvell, it
vvere impoſſible for him to recouer, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvhileſt his diſeaſe
remaineth, hee can not beleeue that hee is recouered, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing noe reaſon to
thinke ſo, but rather the contrarie; ſo if the only meanes for a ſinner
to recouer, bee to beleeue in the middeſt of his ſinnes, that hee is
iuſte, it is impoſſible for him to recouer, bicauſe hee can not vvith
harte thinke ſo, hauing no reaſon for it, but rather to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Hence I gather tvvoe thinges to be noted. Firſt that if a ſinner bee
iuſtified by beleeuing that hee is iuſt, then is hee iuſtified by a lying
faithe, bicauſe hee be leeueth that vvhich is not; and if you ſaye that
ſo ſoone as hee hathe beleeued ſo, hee ſhalbe ſo; that is not
ſufficient, for yet it follovveth that hée beleeueth that hee is
iuſt before hee is iuſte, bicauſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice follovveth faythe, &amp;
ſo he is iuſtified by a falſe, and lying faithe. The ſecond thing
vvhich I note, is hovve malitiouſly and yet hovve couertly the deuill by his
members ſeeketh our damnation. For not content, by theyr doctrine to haue
induced vs to all ſinne, hee taketh a vvaye the meanes of riſing again from
the ſtate of ſinne, denying penaunce to bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, yea affirming
in Luther that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition is a mortall ſinne, and auouching 
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:8434:348"/>in Luther and Caluin bothe, 
<note place="margin">Supra.</note> yea and in all theyr Schollers,
that the only meanes for a ſinner to bee iuſtified, is to beeleeue vvithout
all ſtaggering, and vvith all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible aſſuraunce, that his ſinnes
are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; vvhich beleefe being impoſſible, as is allready proued
(bicauſe it is not in the vnderſtandings povver to beleeue vvhite to bee
blacke, or that a man is iuſte vvhen noe probabilitie of it appeareth) it
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth that vvhen a ſinner is fallen, it is impoſſible for him to
riſe againe, bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it is as impoſſible for him to beleeue that hee
is iuſt before hee ſee ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the ſame, as for a ſicke
man to beleeue that hee is recouered and vvell at eaſe, vvhen hee is in the
middeſt of the fitte of an hoate ageue, or in the panges of deathe. And ſo
our reformers do not only tumble vs headlong into the very depth of ſinne,
but hold vs there in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall duraunce, vvithout hope of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
bicauſe they require at our handes an impoſſibilitie, vvhich is in the

of Athens, Paris, or Louaine, but alſo of all the creaturs in the vvorld. For

bicau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teineth all) receiued his beginning, being, and exiſtence?
If thou ſay vvith Epicure or Democritus, that it vvas made <hi>Fortuito

lengtht I vvill bring thee to a thinge exempt from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhich created
all things, and this I call God. If thou ſayeſt that the vvorld framed it
ſelfe, I muſt needs tell thee that that is impoſſible: bicauſe
nothing can operate or vvorke, before it hathe a being bicauſe as the
Philoſopher ſayeth <hi>prius eſt eſſe, quam agere:</hi> And ſo if
the vvorld made it ſelfe, it vvas before it ſelfe, vvhich im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, a
contradiction. If thou ſay that it vvas nether framed by it ſelfe, nor by
any other cauſe, but vvas euer of it ſelfe, vvithout any making, then thou
makeſt the vvorlde a God, and ſo vvhileſt thou ſeekeſt to deny a God,
thou graunteſt a God. For if it bee of it ſelfe, it is indepe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of any
other, and ſo hathe a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie being vvhich euer vvas and euer

brought from nothing to ſome thing, and ſo euer vvas of neceſſitie,
nether can it bee brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome thing to nothing, and ſo euer ſhalbe,
and that of neceſſitie. If it haue a neceſſarie &amp; inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
being, it hathe an infinite eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, bicauſe it is not limited by anye,
and <pb n="647" facs="tcp:8434:352"/>ſoe exceedeth the bounds of a creature; &amp;
therfore if the vvorlde vvas of it ſelfe, it is a God: vvhich perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
vvithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it can not haue, bicauſe the vvorlds mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
ſubſtance, mutabilitie, viſibilitie, and determinate quantitie, arguethe
a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, not a God, vvho is immaterial, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and infinite in his
immenſitie. Vvho the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas it that created this goodly palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; ſo
huge a building as is this vvorlde? Not it ſelfe, as is proued, not any
Angel, or other creature, bicauſe creation of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, argueth infinit
povver, and vvhere is infinite povver, ther is an infinite eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and
ſo God only vvas hee that could create it. And if thou vvilt obſtinately
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that an Angell, or ſome other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture created it; I vvill thus
argevve againſt thee. ether that creature vvhich thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt to haue
created the vvorlde, vvas of it ſelfe, or it vvas created of another? If it
vvas of it ſelfe, it vvas God, and ſo thou graunteſt, vvhich I endeuour
to vvreſt from thee by force of argument; if it vvas created of another
creature, I aſke vvho created that other, and ſo at the lengthe I vvill
leade thee to the firſt cauſe, vvhich created all, and vvas created of
none, vvhich is the God vvhom vvee ſeek for.</p>
               <p>Secondly not only the vvholle vvorld but alſo euery parte of
it, vvill make a <pb n="648" facs="tcp:8434:353"/>plain remonſtraunce of a God-head. And
to begin vvith man, vvho though hee bee a litle vvorld, yet is but a parte of
the great vvorld; vvho I pray you vvas it, that gaue the firſt man his being?
Vvee ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that men breed not as flyes and vvormes doe of the
corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures, nether do they ſpring out of the
earthe like hearbes or toadſtooles, as Iulius Caeſar ſayd of the firſt
inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untes of England, nether are they begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of beaſts of another
kinde, as mules, and chickins are, but rather as vve ſee by experience, man
only begetteth man, and of no other liuing creatur, no not of an Angel, can he
bee begotten. Vvho then vvas it that gaue the firſt man his being? of him
ſelfe, man could not bee, bicauſe then had hee been a God; of another man
hee could not be begotten, bicauſe no man could bee before the firſt man,
no other creature could beget him, as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proued, <hi>ergô</hi>
ſome thing that vvas no creature created him. And vvhat is that but God?</p>
               <p>Another part of the vvorld, &amp; that the moſt noble, is an
angell: And vvhoe I pray you created thoſe ſpirits and immateriall
ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces? One Angell could not beget a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, bicauſe that vvould
argewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be materiall ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; corruptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, 
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:8434:353"/>and ſo no ſpirits: To ſay that men can produce
Angelles, or that any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture extant could do the ſame, is farre
leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe probable, bicauſe they are the higheſt creatures in perfection,
and ſo could not bee produced of their inferiours. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth therfore
that ſome cauſe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded vvithin the ranke of creaturs, created them:
and vvhat can that bee but the Creatour.

and voyages vvhich they make in the ayre, the ſtraunge apparitions, vvhich
all the vvorld talketh of, and therfore can not lye (bicauſe the voice of the
people is the voice of God) demonſtrateth that ther are angelles and
immaterial ſpirits. And ſeing that theſe creaturs can nether produce one
another, nor bee produced of any create cauſe, vvee muſt needes
confeſſe a God and an increated ſpirit, vvho created them. The like

And the earth being of a heauy and lumpiſh nature, is vvorthilie thruſt

a man of credit tolde mee vvhoe vvas an eye vvitneſſe) the Foxe eſpying
duckes in a riuer, deuiſed this ſtratagem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceue them. hee taketh a

paſſe alſo thorovve them; and this hee did <pb n="660" facs="tcp:8434:359"/>tvviſe, or thriſe. The duckes ſuſpecting nothing, let the
ferne paſſe by them; at the lengthe the foxe him ſelfe come the
ſvviming dovvn the ſtreame, vvith a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne-buſhe in his mouthe, and that
ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly, that nothing appeared aboue the vvater, but the buſhe; the

ſnatche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the at a ducke, and chaungeth his buſhe for the ſame. Hence
I deduce this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: Theſe creaturs are vvitleſſe and deuoid of

is a creature, &amp; ſo as in eſſence and being, ſo in motion and

God?</p>
               <p>Sixtly I vvill bring a morall argument, vvhich alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uinceth
this veritie. It is the opinion euen of the Paganes, to vvhich the light of

that the one deſerueth puniſhment the other revvard, as in the laſt booke

and ſo can not bee Chriſtiane religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in the bookes follovvi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g I
ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve hovve it repugneth to ciuile ſtate and pollicie, hovve iniuriouſe
it is to God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve it openeth the gap vnto all vice and Atheiſme, and ſo
can not bee of God. Yea in the fourth booke I proue that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no
religion, bicauſe they haue noe preeſtes nor ſacrifices nor prayer, &amp;
ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely any ſacramentes, notvvithſtanding that theſe thinges and
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer vvent together. Secondly in the alleaged fifte chapter I haue
compared our ancient pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of vvhom vve receued our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvith their
nevve miniſters of vvhom they receiued theirs, and I haue proued that our
paſtours in all pointes are to be preferred, and conſequently our religion.
Thirdly in the ſecond booke and fifte Chapter, I proue that once Chriſtian
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion vvas planted in the vvorld, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours vvere appointed. I haue
proued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that this religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and theſe Paſtours are neuer to bee
chaunged, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that novv is the true Churche &amp;
religion, vvhich can deriue it ſelfe by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſſion from
the firſt paſtours and the firſt faith that vvas planted and practiſed;
I haue proued alſo that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers haue not this ſucceſſion, and
that <pb n="673" facs="tcp:8434:365"/>Catholikes haue, vvhence it follovveth euidently
that their religion is not the true Chriſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that ours is the
true and only religion. In the Sixte Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I proue that in Chriſtes Church
&amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is peace and vnitie in faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, vvhich Chriſte at
his departure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to his Church, &amp; I haue demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that this
peace and vnitie is not to be found amongeſt the reformers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amongeſt Catholikes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently that the Catholike religion is the
only Chriſtian religion. In the Seuenthe chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I proue that the religion
of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianes is noe particuler ſect, but catholike and
vniuerſall, and one, and the ſame in all countries and ages, and ſeing
that only the Catholike religion hathe this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it follovveth that that
is the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that I ſhall not need to vſe any
other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to proue that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion only, is the true
religion and vvorſhip of God. It remaineth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only, that I novve
declare hovve the reformers open the gappe to a certaine kinde of Atheiſme,
vvhich is irreligioſitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempte of all religion, and bicauſe this
concluſion is often tymes to be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of other pointes of their
doctrine in the Chapters follovvinge, I content my ſelfe in this Chapter
vvith their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <pb n="674" facs="tcp:8434:366"/>alleaged in the former Chapter, and
out of that only I vvill deduce my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded concluſion, vvhich I maye doe
vvith as muche breuitie as facilitie. For if God bee the autour of all ſinne,
then if vvee maye gather vvhat the tree is by the frute, hee is of a malitious
nature as is before proued: and if hee commaund vs impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities and
puniſhe vs vvith Hell fyer for not fullfilling them, then is hee
vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, cruel, and barbarous. And if vvee once make this conceit of
God (as vvee muſt needes) if vvee beleeue the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then
muſt our hartes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie bee cold in religion, and vvorſhip of
God. For vvho can bee induced to vvorſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hip, loue, and honour ſuch a God in
vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me is nothing vvhich is amiable, nothing vvorthy honour? vvel may vvee
feare him for his crueltie, but loue him, and honour him from the harte vve can
not. And ſo religion fallethe.</p>

                  <p>The ſixte Chapter ſhevveth hovv their vvant of a viſible

religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the firſt booke, and laſt chapter, I haue declared at
large, hovve neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a viſible head is in all ſocieties, and
eſpecially in the Church of Chriſte, and I haue alſo demonſtrated, that
ther is no ſuche viſible head in the Synagogue of the reformers; vvhence I
haue inferred, that amongeſt them, it is lavvfull for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye heretike, to
preach vvhat doctrine hee vvill, and no man ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolle him. Novve I ame
to deduce another conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to vvit, that thus alſo the gate and gapp is
opened vnto Atheiſtes, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and irreligious perſons: vvhich I
can do eaſily, and vvill doe in a vvord. For if a viſible head bee
vvanting, euery man may preach and imbrace vvhat reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hee vvill (as in the
alleaged place I haue proued) and ſeing that, if this head bee vvanting, ther
is noe certaintie for any religion, but only the priuate ſpirite, and bare
ſcripture, vvhich are altogether vncertaine, 
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In the firſt booke, ch.</hi> 2.3.</note>
as before is proued, it vvill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovv that a man ſhall haue no more
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to imbrace one religion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, yea hee ſhall haue noe
probable reaſon <pb n="697" facs="tcp:8434:377"/>to induce him to any religion at all,
and conſequentlye he may take good leaue to bee of no religion. And thus he
may argue in forme and figure. If ther be no viſible head to determine by
authoritie vvhat religion is to be imbraced, euery man may be of vvhat religion
he vvill, and no man can controlle him, and ſo I alſo may vſe my libertie
in chooſing my religion, as vvel as another. And ſeing that if the
authoritie of a viſible head be layed a ſide, I haue no more reaſon to
bee of one religion then another (bicauſe all religions, alleage the ſame
reaſon vvhich is no reaſon, to vvit, bare ſcripture ſenſed by the
priuate ſpirite) and I can not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be of all, bicauſe they be
contrarie to one another; I may by good reaſon refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to bee of any
religion, and noe man can controlle me for it, if there bee no viſible head,
vvho can proue that hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the authoritie to determine of religion. And ſo he
that forſaketh the Catholique Church, vvhere only this viſible head is to
bee found, hath leaue and licence to bee of vvhat religion hee vvill, yea to be
of no religion at all, bicauſe leauing that hee hathe noe more reaſon to
bee of one religion then another, bicauſe hee hath no other reaſon then
bare ſcripture ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a priuate ſpirite, vvhich is not
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, <pb n="698" facs="tcp:8434:378"/>as is proued in my firſt booke and third
chapter; yea leauing the Catholike Churche, he can not haue any probable
reaſon to induce him to any of theſe nevv religions, as I haue proued in my
firſt booke, and fifte chapter, and ſeing that God nether can, nor vvill
comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de him to bee of a religion, for vvhich hee ſeeth no reaſon, nor
motiue vvhich is ſufficient to induce a reaſonable man, as in the ſame
place is proued, hee maye vvith reaſon, after hee hath lefte the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

eating, as ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de moſte manifeſte. For firſt our ſauiour
Chriſte, to diſpoſe them to a firme beleefe of this myſterie, made
ſuch a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of fiue barley loaues &amp; tvvo
fiſhes, that hee fed and filled about fiue thouſand perſons thervvith,
and that ſo ſufficiently, that the fragmentes of the banquet vvere as much
as the vvholle fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt. For if hee could make ſo much of a litle, vvhy can
hee not turne bread and vvine into his bodye? and if hee could vvithout
diminution of the feaſt, ſatisfie ſo many, vvhy may hee not feed vs all
vvith his body; vvithout diuiſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the ſame? And if after

Altar, or that after, that the communicantes haue receued it, the Reliques
vvhich they leaue, ſhould remaine ſtill as great as the vvholle ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet

Here Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte beginneth to cloſe vvith them, and to enter in to his

Chriſte) <hi>but Moyſes gaue you not that bread, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only hath
the giuing of bread from heauen. Lord</hi> (ſayed they) <hi>giue vs alvvayes
this bread.</hi> Ieſus anſvvered, <hi>I ame the bread of life.</hi> At
vv<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Ievves murmured, bicauſe they vnderſtood him not. And yet moſt
fitly is he called the bread of life: for firſt in Scripture all that
nouriſheth is called <pb n="705" facs="tcp:8434:381"/>bread: vvherfore ſeing that
Chriſte is the food of our ſoule, vvell is hee called bread, and not
vvhatſoeuer bread, but the bread of life, to diſtinguiſh him from common
bread. Secondly in ſcriptures vvhen one thing is chaunged into another, that
into vvhich the chaunge is made, taketh the name of the thinge chaunged. So the
ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into vvhich Aarons rodd vvas chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged is called a rodde, 
<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> bicauſe it vvas made of a
rodde; vvherfore bicauſe bread vvas to be changed into Chriſtes bodye and
blood, vvell is hee called bread. Thirdly bicauſe his body vvas to bee
couered, vvith the formes of bread, it is called bread bicauſe it hath the
ſhevve and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of bread, 
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.</note> and for this cauſe his blood
is called, <hi>vvine,</hi> and the <hi>blood of the grape,</hi> bicauſe it
vvas to be inueſted as it vvere, vvith the accidentes of vvine in the ſame
bleſſed Sacrament. But not vvithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ievves murmuration,
Chriſte vvill not eate his vvord, but againe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth it; <hi>I ame the
bread of life, your fathers did eate manna in the deſert, and they dyed; this
is the bread that deſcended from heauen, that if a man eate of it he dye not.
And I</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>ame this liuing bread that came from heauen, of
vvhich hee that eateth ſhall liue for euer, and the bread that I vvill giue,
is my felſ he for the life of the vvorld.</hi> Novve hee ſpeaketh his 
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:8434:382"/>mynde plainly, and ſo plainly that he compareth the
figure, vvith the veritie <hi>manna</hi> vvith his bread of the bleſſed
Sacrament, and giues the preminence to the veritie; for (ſayeth hee) <hi>your
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eate of manna and yet dyed,</hi> but <hi>my ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na is a more
ſoueraine viande,</hi> bicauſe vvho ſoeuer eateth of it ſhall liue for
euer. Novv if it bee true that the bleſſed Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſte, is only a ſigne
of Chriſt and his body and blood; then I demaund of our aduerſaries vvith
vvhat ſhevve of truthe Chriſte could preferre it before <hi>manna?</hi>
Vvhy ſhould Chriſtes bread giue life ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>manna,</hi> ſeing
that <hi>manna</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſte, vvho is this bread, as vvell as the
Euchariſt? Yea vnleſſe the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſte contein Chriſtes fleſhe and
blood really, <hi>manna</hi> muſt needes take the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in dignitie, as
it hathe in antiquitie. For firſt <hi>manna</hi> vvas better in

<note place="margin">Sap. 16. Pſal. 77. See the fourth booke
chap. 6.</note> as being made by Angels handes, and in the aire, hauing alſo
all taſtes, as is befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re declared, and ſo in ſubſtaunce
<hi>manna,</hi> is more excellent. In figure and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>manna</hi> is as good, if not better, for if the Euchariſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tein not
really Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes body and bloud, it is but a ſigne and conſequently noe
better then <hi>manna,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſignified the ſame Chriſte, and
ſo vvas as noble a ſigne, &amp; it vvas more apte <pb n="707" facs="tcp:8434:382"/>to
ſignifie, and ſo vvas a fitter figure. for as <hi>Manna,</hi> vvas framed
by Angells handes, 
<note place="margin">

neuer paſſed the heate of the fyer; ſo Chriſte our bread of life, vvas

baked in the ouen of the Virgins vvomb, vvithout all heate of concupiſcence.
As vvhen God rayned dovvn <hi>Manna,</hi> the Ievves cried <hi>Manhu,</hi> that

not haue ſcandalized them, vvho vvere accuſtomed to ſpiritual eating,
nether vvould ſuch meates haue gone againſt their ſtomake, bicauſe
figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue diſhes, vvere their ordinarie fare. Secondly I gather that
Chriſte meant not <pb n="713" facs="tcp:8434:385"/>figuratiue or ſpiritual eating
only, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall and reall eating. For if hee had meant ſo, hee noe
doubte vvould haue explicated him ſelfe, to take avvay all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of
offence and ſcandall, vvhich they conceued, bicauſe they vnderſtood him
of reall eating, as is proued; or if Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin vvill needs haue it, that
Chriſte meant only figuratiue and ſpirituall eating, hee muſt needes
ſay vvith all, that chriſte vvas moſt cruel, and peremptorie, and that
hee endeuoured rather to deceue ſoules, then to ſaue them, &amp; to blinde
them rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to illuminate them: vvhoe, thoughe he perceiued that they
vnderſtood him of his fleſhe, vvhich ſcandalized them, yet vvould not
vouchſafe, to tell them that hee meant only a figuratiue, and ſpirituall
eating; that ſo vvith a vvord hee might haue taken a vvaye the ſcandall,
taught them the truthe, and giuen the deceued ſoules, ſatisfaction.</p>

And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of Caluin, vvhether Chriſte vvas able to turne bread in to his

one hee is very ſaucie to correcte the Euangeliſt, in the other hee lyeth,
bicauſe all the greeke copies, haue it as I haue ſet it dovvne. By this, it
is manifeſt, that as Chriſte promiſed, that hee vvould giue his body and

ſo he gaue really his body and bloud to his Apoſtles, at his laſt

and letter of Scripture is plain for the real preſence; and that the letter
is to bee vnderſtood really, as it ſoundeth, and not metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
tropically, or figuratiuely, I haue proued by many coniectures, and not only
coniecturs, but by a plaine diſcourſe of Chriſte vvith his diſciples,

ancient fathers, vvhoſe arte and profeſſion vvas to interprete
ſcriptures, in vvhich alſo they vvere ſo couning, that for the ſame,
they are as famous amongeſt Chriſtians, as Ariſtotle for Philoſophie or

ſome fathers, vvho ſaye that this Sacrament is not a bare figure, but is
the true fleſh of Chriſte. Saint Chryſoſtome, that golden Mouthe of the

according to his opinion, they are diſtante as farre as heauen and earth, but
ſainct Chriſoſtome ſayeth, that Chriſtes ſubſtaunce in this

<hi>ergo</hi> in very deed, Chriſtes body is in the ſacrament, and by

conſequently it is no greater a miracle, then that the King at the ſame

maketh day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvhoſe vvine is really in the caue or Celler, and at the
ſame tyme in the Iuie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhe vvhich is vvithout the Celler, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in

(gentle reader) the teſtimonies vvhich Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue for the real

are, vvhich the reformers bring againſt <pb n="732" facs="tcp:8434:395"/>it, And fathers

pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſtes body and bloud in the bleſſed Sacrament, as vve
haue for the bleſſed Trinitie, and vvee are as ſure of the real meaning
of the textes, vvhich are alleaged for the real preſence, as of them, vvhich
vvere vſed for proofe of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or Incarnation; bicauſe the texte is
as plaine, and the Interpretours as many and as plain alſo, the
circunſtances alſo of the texte make as much for the real preſence, as
for thoſe other tvoe myſteries; The real preſence is no more
impoſſible, nor incredible, to mans conceite, then thoſe myſteries are,
yea thoſe are of greater dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie. Vvhy then do the reformers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the
Real preſence, rather then the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or Incarnation? If vvee haue as good
proofes for this as for thoſe verities, vve can not beleeue thoſe, but vvee
muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue this, or if theſe teſtimonies bee not ſufficient for the
reale preſence, they are not ſufficient for thoſe verities, and ſo if 
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:8434:395"/>not vvith ſtanding plaine texte, circun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of
the texte, Interpretours of the texte, and practiſe of the Church, vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the real preſence, or doubte of it; vvee muſt neceſſarily doubte of the
Trinitie and Incarnation, and call them, and all the other myſteries of
Chriſtian faithe in queſtion, for vvhich vve haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor no other
proofe, bicauſe one proofe is for all; and as good for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſte, as
for any. And if all the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of chriſtian faith be called in
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then ſeing that vve haue no reaſon to ioyne vvith Turck or Ievv
in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, vvee may bid adevv to all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſorte our
ſelues vvith Atheiſtes, vvho are of no Religion.</p>
